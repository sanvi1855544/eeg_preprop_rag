<h1>uWSGI</h1> <p>uWSGI is a deployment option on servers like <a class="reference external" href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://cherokee-project.com/">cherokee</a>; see <a class="reference internal" href="../fastcgi/index"><span class="doc">FastCGI</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../wsgi-standalone/index"><span class="doc">Standalone WSGI Containers</span></a> for other options. To use your WSGI application with uWSGI protocol you will need a uWSGI server first. uWSGI is both a protocol and an application server; the application server can serve uWSGI, FastCGI, and HTTP protocols.</p> <p>The most popular uWSGI server is <a class="reference external" href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">uwsgi</a>, which we will use for this guide. Make sure to have it installed to follow along.</p> <div class="admonition-watch-out admonition"> <p class="admonition-title">Watch Out</p> <p>Please make sure in advance that any <code>app.run()</code> calls you might have in your application file are inside an <code>if __name__ ==
'__main__':</code> block or moved to a separate file. Just make sure itâ€™s not called because this will always start a local WSGI server which we do not want if we deploy that application to uWSGI.</p> </div>  <h2 id="starting-your-app-with-uwsgi">Starting your app with uwsgi</h2> <p><code>uwsgi</code> is designed to operate on WSGI callables found in python modules.</p> <p>Given a flask application in myapp.py, use the following command:</p> <pre data-language="text">$ uwsgi -s /tmp/yourapplication.sock --manage-script-name --mount /yourapplication=myapp:app
</pre> <p>The <code>--manage-script-name</code> will move the handling of <code>SCRIPT_NAME</code> to uwsgi, since it is smarter about that. It is used together with the <code>--mount</code> directive which will make requests to <code>/yourapplication</code> be directed to <code>myapp:app</code>. If your application is accessible at root level, you can use a single <code>/</code> instead of <code>/yourapplication</code>. <code>myapp</code> refers to the name of the file of your flask application (without extension) or the module which provides <code>app</code>. <code>app</code> is the callable inside of your application (usually the line reads <code>app = Flask(__name__)</code>.</p> <p>If you want to deploy your flask application inside of a virtual environment, you need to also add <code>--virtualenv /path/to/virtual/environment</code>. You might also need to add <code>--plugin python</code> or <code>--plugin python3</code> depending on which python version you use for your project.</p>   <h2 id="configuring-nginx">Configuring nginx</h2> <p>A basic flask nginx configuration looks like this:</p> <pre data-language="python">location = /yourapplication { rewrite ^ /yourapplication/; }
location /yourapplication { try_files $uri @yourapplication; }
location @yourapplication {
  include uwsgi_params;
  uwsgi_pass unix:/tmp/yourapplication.sock;
}
</pre> <p>This configuration binds the application to <code>/yourapplication</code>. If you want to have it in the URL root its a bit simpler:</p> <pre data-language="python">location / { try_files $uri @yourapplication; }
location @yourapplication {
    include uwsgi_params;
    uwsgi_pass unix:/tmp/yourapplication.sock;
}
