<h1>CGI</h1> <p>If all other deployment methods do not work, CGI will work for sure. CGI is supported by all major servers but usually has a sub-optimal performance.</p> <p>This is also the way you can use a Flask application on Google’s <a class="reference external" href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/">App Engine</a>, where execution happens in a CGI-like environment.</p> <div class="admonition-watch-out admonition"> <p class="admonition-title">Watch Out</p> <p>Please make sure in advance that any <code>app.run()</code> calls you might have in your application file are inside an <code>if __name__ ==
'__main__':</code> block or moved to a separate file. Just make sure it’s not called because this will always start a local WSGI server which we do not want if we deploy that application to CGI / app engine.</p> <p>With CGI, you will also have to make sure that your code does not contain any <code>print</code> statements, or that <code>sys.stdout</code> is overridden by something that doesn’t write into the HTTP response.</p> </div>  <h2 id="creating-a-cgi-file">Creating a <code>.cgi</code> file</h2> <p>First you need to create the CGI application file. Let’s call it <code>yourapplication.cgi</code>:</p> <pre data-language="python">#!/usr/bin/python
from wsgiref.handlers import CGIHandler
from yourapplication import app

CGIHandler().run(app)
</pre>   <h2 id="server-setup">Server Setup</h2> <p>Usually there are two ways to configure the server. Either just copy the <code>.cgi</code> into a <code>cgi-bin</code> (and use <code>mod_rewrite</code> or something similar to rewrite the URL) or let the server point to the file directly.</p> <p>In Apache for example you can put something like this into the config:</p> <pre data-language="apache">ScriptAlias /app /path/to/the/application.cgi
</pre> <p>On shared webhosting, though, you might not have access to your Apache config. In this case, a file called <code>.htaccess</code>, sitting in the public directory you want your app to be available, works too but the <code>ScriptAlias</code> directive won’t work in that case:</p> <pre data-language="apache">RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f # Don't interfere with static files
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /path/to/the/application.cgi/$1 [L]
</pre> <p>For more information consult the documentation of your webserver.</p><div class="_attribution">
