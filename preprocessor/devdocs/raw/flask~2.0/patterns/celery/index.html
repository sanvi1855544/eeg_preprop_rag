<h1>Celery Background Tasks</h1> <p>If your application has a long running task, such as processing some uploaded data or sending email, you don’t want to wait for it to finish during a request. Instead, use a task queue to send the necessary data to another process that will run the task in the background while the request returns immediately.</p> <p>Celery is a powerful task queue that can be used for simple background tasks as well as complex multi-stage programs and schedules. This guide will show you how to configure Celery using Flask, but assumes you’ve already read the <a class="reference external" href="https://celery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/first-steps-with-celery.html">First Steps with Celery</a> guide in the Celery documentation.</p>  <h2 id="install">Install</h2> <p>Celery is a separate Python package. Install it from PyPI using pip:</p> <pre data-language="python">$ pip install celery
</pre>   <h2 id="configure">Configure</h2> <p>The first thing you need is a Celery instance, this is called the celery application. It serves the same purpose as the <a class="reference internal" href="../../api/index#flask.Flask" title="flask.Flask"><code>Flask</code></a> object in Flask, just for Celery. Since this instance is used as the entry-point for everything you want to do in Celery, like creating tasks and managing workers, it must be possible for other modules to import it.</p> <p>For instance you can place this in a <code>tasks</code> module. While you can use Celery without any reconfiguration with Flask, it becomes a bit nicer by subclassing tasks and adding support for Flask’s application contexts and hooking it up with the Flask configuration.</p> <p>This is all that is necessary to properly integrate Celery with Flask:</p> <pre data-language="python">from celery import Celery

def make_celery(app):
    celery = Celery(
        app.import_name,
        backend=app.config['CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND'],
        broker=app.config['CELERY_BROKER_URL']
    )
    celery.conf.update(app.config)

    class ContextTask(celery.Task):
        def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            with app.app_context():
                return self.run(*args, **kwargs)

    celery.Task = ContextTask
    return celery
</pre> <p>The function creates a new Celery object, configures it with the broker from the application config, updates the rest of the Celery config from the Flask config and then creates a subclass of the task that wraps the task execution in an application context.</p>   <h2 id="an-example-task">An example task</h2> <p>Let’s write a task that adds two numbers together and returns the result. We configure Celery’s broker and backend to use Redis, create a <code>celery</code> application using the factor from above, and then use it to define the task.</p> <pre data-language="python">from flask import Flask

flask_app = Flask(__name__)
flask_app.config.update(
    CELERY_BROKER_URL='redis://localhost:6379',
    CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND='redis://localhost:6379'
)
celery = make_celery(flask_app)

@celery.task()
def add_together(a, b):
    return a + b
</pre> <p>This task can now be called in the background:</p> <pre data-language="python">result = add_together.delay(23, 42)
result.wait()  # 65
</pre>   <h2 id="run-a-worker">Run a worker</h2> <p>If you jumped in and already executed the above code you will be disappointed to learn that <code>.wait()</code> will never actually return. That’s because you also need to run a Celery worker to receive and execute the task.</p> <pre data-language="python">$ celery -A your_application.celery worker
</pre> <p>The <code>your_application</code> string has to point to your application’s package or module that creates the <code>celery</code> object.</p> <p>Now that the worker is running, <code>wait</code> will return the result once the task is finished.</p><div class="_attribution">
