# Poly1d

## Basics

`poly1d`(c_or_r[, r, variable]) | A one-dimensional polynomial class.  
---|---  
`polyval`(p, x) | Evaluate a polynomial at specific values.  
`poly`(seq_of_zeros) | Find the coefficients of a polynomial with the given sequence of roots.  
`roots`(p) | Return the roots of a polynomial with coefficients given in p.  
## Fitting

`polyfit`(x, y, deg[, rcond, full, w, cov]) | Least squares polynomial fit.  
---|---  
## Calculus

`polyder`(p[, m]) | Return the derivative of the specified order of a polynomial.  
---|---  
`polyint`(p[, m, k]) | Return an antiderivative (indefinite integral) of a polynomial.  
## Arithmetic

`polyadd`(a1, a2) | Find the sum of two polynomials.  
---|---  
`polydiv`(u, v) | Returns the quotient and remainder of polynomial division.  
`polymul`(a1, a2) | Find the product of two polynomials.  
`polysub`(a1, a2) | Difference (subtraction) of two polynomials.  
## Warnings

`RankWarning` | Issued by `polyfit` when the Vandermonde matrix is rank deficient.
