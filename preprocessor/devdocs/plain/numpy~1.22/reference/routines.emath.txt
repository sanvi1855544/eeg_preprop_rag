# Mathematical functions with automatic domain (numpy.emath)

Note

`numpy.emath` is a preferred alias for `numpy.lib.scimath`, available after
`numpy` is imported.

Wrapper functions to more user-friendly calling of certain math functions
whose output data-type is different than the input data-type in certain
domains of the input.

For example, for functions like `log` with branch cuts, the versions in this
module provide the mathematically valid answers in the complex plane:

    
    >>> import math
    >>> np.emath.log(-math.exp(1)) == (1+1j*math.pi)
    True
    
Similarly, `sqrt`, other base logarithms, `power` and trig functions are
correctly handled. See their respective docstrings for specific examples.

## Functions

`sqrt`(x) | Compute the square root of x.  
---|---  
`log`(x) | Compute the natural logarithm of `x`.  
`log2`(x) | Compute the logarithm base 2 of `x`.  
`logn`(n, x) | Take log base n of x.  
`log10`(x) | Compute the logarithm base 10 of `x`.  
`power`(x, p) | Return x to the power p, (x**p).  
`arccos`(x) | Compute the inverse cosine of x.  
`arcsin`(x) | Compute the inverse sine of x.  
`arctanh`(x) | Compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of `x`.
