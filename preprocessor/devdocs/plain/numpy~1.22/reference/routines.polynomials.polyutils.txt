# Polyutils

Utility classes and functions for the polynomial modules.

This module provides: error and warning objects; a polynomial base class; and
some routines used in both the `polynomial` and `chebyshev` modules.

## Warning objects

`RankWarning` | Issued by chebfit when the design matrix is rank deficient.  
---|---  
## Functions

`as_series`(alist[, trim]) | Return argument as a list of 1-d arrays.  
---|---  
`trimseq`(seq) | Remove small Poly series coefficients.  
`trimcoef`(c[, tol]) | Remove "small" "trailing" coefficients from a polynomial.  
`getdomain`(x) | Return a domain suitable for given abscissae.  
`mapdomain`(x, old, new) | Apply linear map to input points.  
`mapparms`(old, new) | Linear map parameters between domains.
