# numpy.random.MT19937.jumped

method

random.MT19937.jumped(jumps=1)

    
Returns a new bit generator with the state jumped

The state of the returned big generator is jumped as-if 2**(128 * jumps)
random numbers have been generated.

Parameters

    
jumpsinteger, positive

    
Number of times to jump the state of the bit generator returned

Returns

    
bit_generatorMT19937

    
New instance of generator jumped iter times

#### Notes

The jump step is computed using a modified version of Matsumoto’s
implementation of Horner’s method. The step polynomial is precomputed to
perform 2**128 steps. The jumped state has been verified to match the state
produced using Matsumoto’s original code.
