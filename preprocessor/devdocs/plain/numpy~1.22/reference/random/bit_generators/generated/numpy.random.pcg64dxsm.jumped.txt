# numpy.random.PCG64DXSM.jumped

method

random.PCG64DXSM.jumped(jumps=1)

    
Returns a new bit generator with the state jumped.

Jumps the state as-if jumps * 210306068529402873165736369884012333109 random
numbers have been generated.

Parameters

    
jumpsinteger, positive

    
Number of times to jump the state of the bit generator returned

Returns

    
bit_generatorPCG64DXSM

    
New instance of generator jumped iter times

#### Notes

The step size is phi-1 when multiplied by 2**128 where phi is the golden
ratio.
