# numpy.random.SeedSequence.generate_state

method

random.SeedSequence.generate_state(n_words, dtype=np.uint32)

    
Return the requested number of words for PRNG seeding.

A BitGenerator should call this method in its constructor with an appropriate
`n_words` parameter to properly seed itself.

Parameters

    
n_wordsint

dtypenp.uint32 or np.uint64, optional

    
The size of each word. This should only be either `uint32` or `uint64`.
Strings (`‘uint32’`, `‘uint64’`) are fine. Note that requesting `uint64` will
draw twice as many bits as `uint32` for the same `n_words`. This is a
convenience for `BitGenerator`s that express their states as `uint64` arrays.

Returns

    
stateuint32 or uint64 array, shape=(n_words,)
