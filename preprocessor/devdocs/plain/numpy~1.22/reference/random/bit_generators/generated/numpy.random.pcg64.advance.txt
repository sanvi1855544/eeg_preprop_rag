# numpy.random.PCG64.advance

method

random.PCG64.advance(delta)

    
Advance the underlying RNG as-if delta draws have occurred.

Parameters

    
deltainteger, positive

    
Number of draws to advance the RNG. Must be less than the size state variable
in the underlying RNG.

Returns

    
selfPCG64

    
RNG advanced delta steps

#### Notes

Advancing a RNG updates the underlying RNG state as-if a given number of calls
to the underlying RNG have been made. In general there is not a one-to-one
relationship between the number output random values from a particular
distribution and the number of draws from the core RNG. This occurs for two
reasons:

  * The random values are simulated using a rejection-based method and so, on average, more than one value from the underlying RNG is required to generate an single draw.
  * The number of bits required to generate a simulated value differs from the number of bits generated by the underlying RNG. For example, two 16-bit integer values can be simulated from a single draw of a 32-bit RNG.

Advancing the RNG state resets any pre-computed random numbers. This is
required to ensure exact reproducibility.
