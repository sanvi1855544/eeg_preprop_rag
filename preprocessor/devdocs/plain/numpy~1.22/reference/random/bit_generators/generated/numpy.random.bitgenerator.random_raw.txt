# numpy.random.BitGenerator.random_raw

method

random.BitGenerator.random_raw(self, size=None)

    
Return randoms as generated by the underlying BitGenerator

Parameters

    
sizeint or tuple of ints, optional

    
Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., `(m, n, k)`, then `m * n * k`
samples are drawn. Default is None, in which case a single value is returned.

outputbool, optional

    
Output values. Used for performance testing since the generated values are not
returned.

Returns

    
outuint or ndarray

    
Drawn samples.

#### Notes

This method directly exposes the the raw underlying pseudo-random number
generator. All values are returned as unsigned 64-bit values irrespective of
the number of bits produced by the PRNG.

See the class docstring for the number of bits returned.
