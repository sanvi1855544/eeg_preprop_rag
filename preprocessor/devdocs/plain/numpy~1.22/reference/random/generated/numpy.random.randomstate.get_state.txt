# numpy.random.RandomState.get_state

method

random.RandomState.get_state()

    
Return a tuple representing the internal state of the generator.

For more details, see `set_state`.

Parameters

    
legacybool, optional

    
Flag indicating to return a legacy tuple state when the BitGenerator is
MT19937, instead of a dict.

Returns

    
out{tuple(str, ndarray of 624 uints, int, int, float), dict}

    
The returned tuple has the following items:

  1. the string ‘MT19937’.
  2. a 1-D array of 624 unsigned integer keys.
  3. an integer `pos`.
  4. an integer `has_gauss`.
  5. a float `cached_gaussian`.

If `legacy` is False, or the BitGenerator is not MT19937, then state is
returned as a dictionary.

#### Notes

`set_state` and `get_state` are not needed to work with any of the random
distributions in NumPy. If the internal state is manually altered, the user
should know exactly what he/she is doing.
