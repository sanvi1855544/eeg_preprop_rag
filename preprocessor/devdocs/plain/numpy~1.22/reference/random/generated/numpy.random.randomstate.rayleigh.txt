# numpy.random.RandomState.rayleigh

method

random.RandomState.rayleigh(scale=1.0, size=None)

    
Draw samples from a Rayleigh distribution.

The \\(\chi\\) and Weibull distributions are generalizations of the Rayleigh.

Note

New code should use the `rayleigh` method of a `default_rng()` instance
instead; please see the Quick Start.

Parameters

    
scalefloat or array_like of floats, optional

    
Scale, also equals the mode. Must be non-negative. Default is 1.

sizeint or tuple of ints, optional

    
Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., `(m, n, k)`, then `m * n * k`
samples are drawn. If size is `None` (default), a single value is returned if
`scale` is a scalar. Otherwise, `np.array(scale).size` samples are drawn.

Returns

    
outndarray or scalar

    
Drawn samples from the parameterized Rayleigh distribution.

`Generator.rayleigh`

    
which should be used for new code.

#### Notes

The probability density function for the Rayleigh distribution is

\\[P(x;scale) = \frac{x}{scale^2}e^{\frac{-x^2}{2 \cdotp scale^2}}\\]

The Rayleigh distribution would arise, for example, if the East and North
components of the wind velocity had identical zero-mean Gaussian
distributions. Then the wind speed would have a Rayleigh distribution.

#### Examples

Draw values from the distribution and plot the histogram

    
    >>> from matplotlib.pyplot import hist
    >>> values = hist(np.random.rayleigh(3, 100000), bins=200, density=True)
    
Wave heights tend to follow a Rayleigh distribution. If the mean wave height
is 1 meter, what fraction of waves are likely to be larger than 3 meters?

    
    >>> meanvalue = 1
    >>> modevalue = np.sqrt(2 / np.pi) * meanvalue
    >>> s = np.random.rayleigh(modevalue, 1000000)
    
The percentage of waves larger than 3 meters is:

    
    >>> 100.*sum(s>3)/1000000.
