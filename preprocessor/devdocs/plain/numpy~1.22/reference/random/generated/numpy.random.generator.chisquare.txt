# numpy.random.Generator.chisquare

method

random.Generator.chisquare(df, size=None)

    
Draw samples from a chi-square distribution.

When `df` independent random variables, each with standard normal
distributions (mean 0, variance 1), are squared and summed, the resulting
distribution is chi-square (see Notes). This distribution is often used in
hypothesis testing.

Parameters

    
dffloat or array_like of floats

    
Number of degrees of freedom, must be > 0.

sizeint or tuple of ints, optional

    
Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., `(m, n, k)`, then `m * n * k`
samples are drawn. If size is `None` (default), a single value is returned if
`df` is a scalar. Otherwise, `np.array(df).size` samples are drawn.

Returns

    
outndarray or scalar

    
Drawn samples from the parameterized chi-square distribution.

Raises

    
ValueError

    
When `df` <= 0 or when an inappropriate `size` (e.g. `size=-1`) is given.

#### Notes

The variable obtained by summing the squares of `df` independent, standard
normally distributed random variables:

\\[Q = \sum_{i=0}^{\mathtt{df}} X^2_i\\]

is chi-square distributed, denoted

\\[Q \sim \chi^2_k.\\]

The probability density function of the chi-squared distribution is

\\[p(x) = \frac{(1/2)^{k/2}}{\Gamma(k/2)} x^{k/2 - 1} e^{-x/2},\\]

where \\(\Gamma\\) is the gamma function,

\\[\Gamma(x) = \int_0^{-\infty} t^{x - 1} e^{-t} dt.\\]
