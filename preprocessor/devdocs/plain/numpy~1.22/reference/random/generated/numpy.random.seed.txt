# numpy.random.seed

random.seed(self, seed=None)

    
Reseed a legacy MT19937 BitGenerator

#### Notes

This is a convenience, legacy function.

The best practice is to not reseed a BitGenerator, rather to recreate a new
one. This method is here for legacy reasons. This example demonstrates best
practice.

    
    >>> from numpy.random import MT19937
    >>> from numpy.random import RandomState, SeedSequence
    >>> rs = RandomState(MT19937(SeedSequence(123456789)))
    # Later, you want to restart the stream
    >>> rs = RandomState(MT19937(SeedSequence(987654321)))
