# numpy.random.exponential

random.exponential(scale=1.0, size=None)

    
Draw samples from an exponential distribution.

Its probability density function is

\\[f(x; \frac{1}{\beta}) = \frac{1}{\beta} \exp(-\frac{x}{\beta}),\\]

for `x > 0` and 0 elsewhere. \\(\beta\\) is the scale parameter, which is the
inverse of the rate parameter \\(\lambda = 1/\beta\\). The rate parameter is
an alternative, widely used parameterization of the exponential distribution
[3].

The exponential distribution is a continuous analogue of the geometric
distribution. It describes many common situations, such as the size of
raindrops measured over many rainstorms [1], or the time between page requests
to Wikipedia [2].

Note

New code should use the `exponential` method of a `default_rng()` instance
instead; please see the Quick Start.

Parameters

    
scalefloat or array_like of floats

    
The scale parameter, \\(\beta = 1/\lambda\\). Must be non-negative.

sizeint or tuple of ints, optional

    
Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., `(m, n, k)`, then `m * n * k`
samples are drawn. If size is `None` (default), a single value is returned if
`scale` is a scalar. Otherwise, `np.array(scale).size` samples are drawn.

Returns

    
outndarray or scalar

    
Drawn samples from the parameterized exponential distribution.
