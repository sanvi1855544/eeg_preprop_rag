# numpy.random.RandomState.shuffle

method

random.RandomState.shuffle(x)

    
Modify a sequence in-place by shuffling its contents.

This function only shuffles the array along the first axis of a multi-
dimensional array. The order of sub-arrays is changed but their contents
remains the same.

Note

New code should use the `shuffle` method of a `default_rng()` instance
instead; please see the Quick Start.

Parameters

    
xndarray or MutableSequence

    
The array, list or mutable sequence to be shuffled.

Returns

    
None

which should be used for new code.

#### Examples

    
    >>> arr = np.arange(10)
    >>> np.random.shuffle(arr)
    >>> arr
    [1 7 5 2 9 4 3 6 0 8] # random
    
Multi-dimensional arrays are only shuffled along the first axis:

    
    >>> arr = np.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
    >>> np.random.shuffle(arr)
    >>> arr
    array([[3, 4, 5], # random
           [6, 7, 8],
           [0, 1, 2]])
