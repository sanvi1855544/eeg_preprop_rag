# numpy.lib.arraysetops

Set operations for arrays based on sorting.

## Notes

For floating point arrays, inaccurate results may appear due to usual round-
off and floating point comparison issues.

Speed could be gained in some operations by an implementation of `numpy.sort`,
that can provide directly the permutation vectors, thus avoiding calls to
`numpy.argsort`.
