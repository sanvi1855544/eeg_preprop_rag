# numpy.polynomial.polynomial.polysub

polynomial.polynomial.polysub(c1, c2)[source]

    
Subtract one polynomial from another.

Returns the difference of two polynomials `c1` \- `c2`. The arguments are
sequences of coefficients from lowest order term to highest, i.e., [1,2,3]
represents the polynomial `1 + 2*x + 3*x**2`.

Parameters

    
c1, c2array_like

    
1-D arrays of polynomial coefficients ordered from low to high.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
Of coefficients representing their difference.

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> P.polysub(c1,c2)
    array([-2.,  0.,  2.])
    >>> P.polysub(c2,c1) # -P.polysub(c1,c2)
    array([ 2.,  0., -2.])
