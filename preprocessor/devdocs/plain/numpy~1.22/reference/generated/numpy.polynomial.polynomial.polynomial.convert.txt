# numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial.convert

method

polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial.convert(domain=None, kind=None,
window=None)[source]

    
Convert series to a different kind and/or domain and/or window.

Parameters

    
domainarray_like, optional

    
The domain of the converted series. If the value is None, the default domain
of `kind` is used.

kindclass, optional

    
The polynomial series type class to which the current instance should be
converted. If kind is None, then the class of the current instance is used.

windowarray_like, optional

    
The window of the converted series. If the value is None, the default window
of `kind` is used.

Returns

    
new_seriesseries

    
The returned class can be of different type than the current instance and/or
have a different domain and/or different window.

#### Notes

Conversion between domains and class types can result in numerically ill
defined series.
