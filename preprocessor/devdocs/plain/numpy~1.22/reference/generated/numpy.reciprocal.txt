# numpy.reciprocal

numpy.reciprocal(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind',
order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'reciprocal'>

    
Return the reciprocal of the argument, element-wise.

Calculates `1/x`.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
Input array.

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
yndarray

    
Return array. This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

#### Notes

Note

This function is not designed to work with integers.

For integer arguments with absolute value larger than 1 the result is always
zero because of the way Python handles integer division. For integer zero the
result is an overflow.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.reciprocal(2.)
    0.5
    >>> np.reciprocal([1, 2., 3.33])
    array([ 1.       ,  0.5      ,  0.3003003])
