# numpy.roots

numpy.roots(p)[source]

    
Return the roots of a polynomial with coefficients given in p.

Note

This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the new
polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred. A summary of the
differences can be found in the transition guide.

The values in the rank-1 array `p` are coefficients of a polynomial. If the
length of `p` is n+1 then the polynomial is described by:

    
    p[0] * x**n + p[1] * x**(n-1) + ... + p[n-1]*x + p[n]
    
Parameters

    
parray_like

    
Rank-1 array of polynomial coefficients.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
An array containing the roots of the polynomial.

Raises

    
ValueError

    
When `p` cannot be converted to a rank-1 array.

See also

`poly`

    
Find the coefficients of a polynomial with a given sequence of roots.

`polyval`

    
Compute polynomial values.

`polyfit`

    
Least squares polynomial fit.

`poly1d`

    
A one-dimensional polynomial class.

#### Notes

The algorithm relies on computing the eigenvalues of the companion matrix [1].
