# numpy.polynomial.laguerre.Laguerre.trim

method

polynomial.laguerre.Laguerre.trim(tol=0)[source]

    
Remove trailing coefficients

Remove trailing coefficients until a coefficient is reached whose absolute
value greater than `tol` or the beginning of the series is reached. If all the
coefficients would be removed the series is set to `[0]`. A new series
instance is returned with the new coefficients. The current instance remains
unchanged.

Parameters

    
tolnon-negative number.

    
All trailing coefficients less than `tol` will be removed.

Returns

    
new_seriesseries

    
New instance of series with trimmed coefficients.
