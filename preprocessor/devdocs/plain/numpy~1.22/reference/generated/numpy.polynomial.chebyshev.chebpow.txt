# numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebpow

polynomial.chebyshev.chebpow(c, pow, maxpower=16)[source]

    
Raise a Chebyshev series to a power.

Returns the Chebyshev series `c` raised to the power `pow`. The argument `c`
is a sequence of coefficients ordered from low to high. i.e., [1,2,3] is the
series `T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2.`

Parameters

    
carray_like

    
1-D array of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to high.

powinteger

    
Power to which the series will be raised

maxpowerinteger, optional

    
Maximum power allowed. This is mainly to limit growth of the series to
unmanageable size. Default is 16

Returns

    
coefndarray

    
Chebyshev series of power.
