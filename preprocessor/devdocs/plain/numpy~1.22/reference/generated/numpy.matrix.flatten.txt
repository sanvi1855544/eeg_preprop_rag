# numpy.matrix.flatten

method

matrix.flatten(order='C')[source]

    
Return a flattened copy of the matrix.

All `N` elements of the matrix are placed into a single row.

Parameters

    
order{‘C’, ‘F’, ‘A’, ‘K’}, optional

    
‘C’ means to flatten in row-major (C-style) order. ‘F’ means to flatten in
column-major (Fortran-style) order. ‘A’ means to flatten in column-major order
if `m` is Fortran contiguous in memory, row-major order otherwise. ‘K’ means
to flatten `m` in the order the elements occur in memory. The default is ‘C’.

Returns

    
ymatrix

    
A copy of the matrix, flattened to a `(1, N)` matrix where `N` is the number
of elements in the original matrix.

See also

`ravel`

    
Return a flattened array.

`flat`

    
A 1-D flat iterator over the matrix.

#### Examples

    
    >>> m = np.matrix([[1,2], [3,4]])
    >>> m.flatten()
    matrix([[1, 2, 3, 4]])
    >>> m.flatten('F')
    matrix([[1, 3, 2, 4]])
