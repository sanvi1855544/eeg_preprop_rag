# numpy.append

numpy.append(arr, values, axis=None)[source]

    
Append values to the end of an array.

Parameters

    
arrarray_like

    
Values are appended to a copy of this array.

valuesarray_like

    
These values are appended to a copy of `arr`. It must be of the correct shape
(the same shape as `arr`, excluding `axis`). If `axis` is not specified,
`values` can be any shape and will be flattened before use.

axisint, optional

    
The axis along which `values` are appended. If `axis` is not given, both `arr`
and `values` are flattened before use.

Returns

    
appendndarray

    
A copy of `arr` with `values` appended to `axis`. Note that `append` does not
occur in-place: a new array is allocated and filled. If `axis` is None, `out`
is a flattened array.

See also

`insert`

    
Insert elements into an array.

`delete`

    
Delete elements from an array.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.append([1, 2, 3], [[4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    array([1, 2, 3, ..., 7, 8, 9])
    
When `axis` is specified, `values` must have the correct shape.

    
    >>> np.append([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9]], axis=0)
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6],
           [7, 8, 9]])
    >>> np.append([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [7, 8, 9], axis=0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions, but
    the array at index 0 has 2 dimension(s) and the array at index 1 has 1
    dimension(s)
