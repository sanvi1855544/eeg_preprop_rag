# numpy.degrees

numpy.degrees(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K',
dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'degrees'>

    
Convert angles from radians to degrees.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
Input array in radians.

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
yndarray of floats

    
The corresponding degree values; if `out` was supplied this is a reference to
it. This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

#### Examples

Convert a radian array to degrees

    
    >>> rad = np.arange(12.)*np.pi/6
    >>> np.degrees(rad)
    array([   0.,   30.,   60.,   90.,  120.,  150.,  180.,  210.,  240.,
            270.,  300.,  330.])
    
    
    >>> out = np.zeros((rad.shape))
    >>> r = np.degrees(rad, out)
    >>> np.all(r == out)
    True
