# numpy.less

numpy.less(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K',
dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'less'>

    
Return the truth value of (x1 < x2) element-wise.

Parameters

    
x1, x2array_like

    
Input arrays. If `x1.shape != x2.shape`, they must be broadcastable to a
common shape (which becomes the shape of the output).

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
outndarray or scalar

    
Output array, element-wise comparison of `x1` and `x2`. Typically of type
bool, unless `dtype=object` is passed. This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2`
are scalars.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.less([1, 2], [2, 2])
    array([ True, False])
    
The `<` operator can be used as a shorthand for `np.less` on ndarrays.

    
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2])
    >>> b = np.array([2, 2])
    >>> a < b
    array([ True, False])
