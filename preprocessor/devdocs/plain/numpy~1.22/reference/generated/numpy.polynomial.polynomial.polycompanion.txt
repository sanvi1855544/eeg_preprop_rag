# numpy.polynomial.polynomial.polycompanion

polynomial.polynomial.polycompanion(c)[source]

    
Return the companion matrix of c.

The companion matrix for power series cannot be made symmetric by scaling the
basis, so this function differs from those for the orthogonal polynomials.

Parameters

    
carray_like

    
1-D array of polynomial coefficients ordered from low to high degree.

Returns

    
matndarray

    
Companion matrix of dimensions (deg, deg).
