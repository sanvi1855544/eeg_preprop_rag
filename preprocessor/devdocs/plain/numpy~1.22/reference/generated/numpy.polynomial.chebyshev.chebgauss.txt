# numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebgauss

polynomial.chebyshev.chebgauss(deg)[source]

    
Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature.

Computes the sample points and weights for Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature. These
sample points and weights will correctly integrate polynomials of degree
\\(2*deg - 1\\) or less over the interval \\([-1, 1]\\) with the weight
function \\(f(x) = 1/\sqrt{1 - x^2}\\).

Parameters

    
degint

    
Number of sample points and weights. It must be >= 1.

Returns

    
xndarray

    
1-D ndarray containing the sample points.

yndarray

    
1-D ndarray containing the weights.

#### Notes

New in version 1.7.0.

The results have only been tested up to degree 100, higher degrees may be
problematic. For Gauss-Chebyshev there are closed form solutions for the
sample points and weights. If n = `deg`, then

\\[x_i = \cos(\pi (2 i - 1) / (2 n))\\]

\\[w_i = \pi / n\\]
