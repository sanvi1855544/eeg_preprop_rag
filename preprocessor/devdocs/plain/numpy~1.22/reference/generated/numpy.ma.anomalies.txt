# numpy.ma.anomalies

ma.anomalies(self, axis=None, dtype=None) = <numpy.ma.core._frommethod object>

    
Compute the anomalies (deviations from the arithmetic mean) along the given
axis.

Returns an array of anomalies, with the same shape as the input and where the
arithmetic mean is computed along the given axis.

Parameters

    
axisint, optional

    
Axis over which the anomalies are taken. The default is to use the mean of the
flattened array as reference.

dtypedtype, optional

    
Type to use in computing the variance. For arrays of integer type

    
the default is float32; for arrays of float types it is the same as the array
type.

See also

`mean`

    
Compute the mean of the array.

#### Examples

    
    >>> a = np.ma.array([1,2,3])
    >>> a.anom()
    masked_array(data=[-1.,  0.,  1.],
                 mask=False,
           fill_value=1e+20)
