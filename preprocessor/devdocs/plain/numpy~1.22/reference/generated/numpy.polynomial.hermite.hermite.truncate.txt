# numpy.polynomial.hermite.Hermite.truncate

method

polynomial.hermite.Hermite.truncate(size)[source]

    
Truncate series to length `size`.

Reduce the series to length `size` by discarding the high degree terms. The
value of `size` must be a positive integer. This can be useful in least
squares where the coefficients of the high degree terms may be very small.

Parameters

    
sizepositive int

    
The series is reduced to length `size` by discarding the high degree terms.
The value of `size` must be a positive integer.

Returns

    
new_seriesseries

    
New instance of series with truncated coefficients.
