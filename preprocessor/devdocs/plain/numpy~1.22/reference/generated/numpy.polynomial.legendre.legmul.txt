# numpy.polynomial.legendre.legmul

polynomial.legendre.legmul(c1, c2)[source]

    
Multiply one Legendre series by another.

Returns the product of two Legendre series `c1` * `c2`. The arguments are
sequences of coefficients, from lowest order “term” to highest, e.g., [1,2,3]
represents the series `P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2`.

Parameters

    
c1, c2array_like

    
1-D arrays of Legendre series coefficients ordered from low to high.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
Of Legendre series coefficients representing their product.

#### Notes

In general, the (polynomial) product of two C-series results in terms that are
not in the Legendre polynomial basis set. Thus, to express the product as a
Legendre series, it is necessary to “reproject” the product onto said basis
set, which may produce “unintuitive” (but correct) results; see Examples
section below.

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import legendre as L
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2)
    >>> L.legmul(c1,c2) # multiplication requires "reprojection"
    array([  4.33333333,  10.4       ,  11.66666667,   3.6       ]) # may vary
