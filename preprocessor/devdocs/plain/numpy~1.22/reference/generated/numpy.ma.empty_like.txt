# numpy.ma.empty_like

ma.empty_like(prototype, dtype=None, order='K', subok=True, shape=None) =
<numpy.ma.core._convert2ma object>

    
Return a new array with the same shape and type as a given array.

Parameters

    
prototypearray_like

    
The shape and data-type of `prototype` define these same attributes of the
returned array.

dtypedata-type, optional

    
Overrides the data type of the result.

New in version 1.6.0.

order{‘C’, ‘F’, ‘A’, or ‘K’}, optional

    
Overrides the memory layout of the result. ‘C’ means C-order, ‘F’ means
F-order, ‘A’ means ‘F’ if `prototype` is Fortran contiguous, ‘C’ otherwise.
‘K’ means match the layout of `prototype` as closely as possible.

New in version 1.6.0.

subokbool, optional.

    
If True, then the newly created array will use the sub-class type of
`prototype`, otherwise it will be a base-class array. Defaults to True.

shapeint or sequence of ints, optional.

    
Overrides the shape of the result. If order=’K’ and the number of dimensions
is unchanged, will try to keep order, otherwise, order=’C’ is implied.

New in version 1.17.0.

Returns

    
outMaskedArray

    
Array of uninitialized (arbitrary) data with the same shape and type as
`prototype`.

See also

`ones_like`

    
Return an array of ones with shape and type of input.

`zeros_like`

    
Return an array of zeros with shape and type of input.

`full_like`

    
Return a new array with shape of input filled with value.

`empty`

    
Return a new uninitialized array.

#### Notes

This function does not initialize the returned array; to do that use
`zeros_like` or `ones_like` instead. It may be marginally faster than the
functions that do set the array values.

#### Examples

    
    >>> a = ([1,2,3], [4,5,6])                         # a is array-like
    >>> np.empty_like(a)
    array([[-1073741821, -1073741821,           3],    # uninitialized
           [          0,           0, -1073741821]])
    >>> a = np.array([[1., 2., 3.],[4.,5.,6.]])
    >>> np.empty_like(a)
    array([[ -2.00000715e+000,   1.48219694e-323,  -2.00000572e+000], # uninitialized
           [  4.38791518e-305,  -2.00000715e+000,   4.17269252e-309]])
