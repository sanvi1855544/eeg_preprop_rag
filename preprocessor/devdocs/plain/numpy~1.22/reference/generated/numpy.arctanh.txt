# numpy.arctanh

numpy.arctanh(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K',
dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'arctanh'>

    
Inverse hyperbolic tangent element-wise.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
Input array.

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
outndarray or scalar

    
Array of the same shape as `x`. This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

#### Notes

`arctanh` is a multivalued function: for each `x` there are infinitely many
numbers `z` such that `tanh(z) = x`. The convention is to return the `z` whose
imaginary part lies in `[-pi/2, pi/2]`.

For real-valued input data types, `arctanh` always returns real output. For
each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it yields
`nan` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.

For complex-valued input, `arctanh` is a complex analytical function that has
branch cuts `[-1, -inf]` and `[1, inf]` and is continuous from above on the
former and from below on the latter.

The inverse hyperbolic tangent is also known as `atanh` or `tanh^-1`.
