# numpy.trunc

numpy.trunc(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K',
dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'trunc'>

    
Return the truncated value of the input, element-wise.

The truncated value of the scalar `x` is the nearest integer `i` which is
closer to zero than `x` is. In short, the fractional part of the signed number
`x` is discarded.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
Input data.

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
yndarray or scalar

    
The truncated value of each element in `x`. This is a scalar if `x` is a
scalar.
