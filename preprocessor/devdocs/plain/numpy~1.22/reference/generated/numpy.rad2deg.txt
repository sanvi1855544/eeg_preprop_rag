# numpy.rad2deg

numpy.rad2deg(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K',
dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'rad2deg'>

    
Convert angles from radians to degrees.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
Angle in radians.

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
yndarray

    
The corresponding angle in degrees. This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

See also

`deg2rad`

    
Convert angles from degrees to radians.

`unwrap`

    
Remove large jumps in angle by wrapping.

#### Notes

New in version 1.3.0.

rad2deg(x) is `180 * x / pi`.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.rad2deg(np.pi/2)
