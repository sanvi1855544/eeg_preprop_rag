# numpy.ma.MaskedArray.unshare_mask

method

ma.MaskedArray.unshare_mask()[source]

    
Copy the mask and set the sharedmask flag to False.

Whether the mask is shared between masked arrays can be seen from the
`sharedmask` property. `unshare_mask` ensures the mask is not shared. A copy
of the mask is only made if it was shared.
