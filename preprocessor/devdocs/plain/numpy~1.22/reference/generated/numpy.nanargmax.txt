# numpy.nanargmax

numpy.nanargmax(a, axis=None, out=None, *, keepdims=<no value>)[source]

    
Return the indices of the maximum values in the specified axis ignoring NaNs.
For all-NaN slices `ValueError` is raised. Warning: the results cannot be
trusted if a slice contains only NaNs and -Infs.

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
Input data.

axisint, optional

    
Axis along which to operate. By default flattened input is used.

outarray, optional

    
If provided, the result will be inserted into this array. It should be of the
appropriate shape and dtype.

New in version 1.22.0.

keepdimsbool, optional

    
If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as
dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast
correctly against the array.

New in version 1.22.0.

Returns

    
index_arrayndarray

    
An array of indices or a single index value.
