# numpy.polynomial.hermite.hermgauss

polynomial.hermite.hermgauss(deg)[source]

    
Gauss-Hermite quadrature.

Computes the sample points and weights for Gauss-Hermite quadrature. These
sample points and weights will correctly integrate polynomials of degree
\\(2*deg - 1\\) or less over the interval \\([-\inf, \inf]\\) with the weight
function \\(f(x) = \exp(-x^2)\\).

Parameters

    
degint

    
Number of sample points and weights. It must be >= 1.

Returns

    
xndarray

    
1-D ndarray containing the sample points.

yndarray

    
1-D ndarray containing the weights.

#### Notes

New in version 1.7.0.

The results have only been tested up to degree 100, higher degrees may be
problematic. The weights are determined by using the fact that

\\[w_k = c / (H'_n(x_k) * H_{n-1}(x_k))\\]

where \\(c\\) is a constant independent of \\(k\\) and \\(x_k\\) is the k’th
root of \\(H_n\\), and then scaling the results to get the right value when
integrating 1.
