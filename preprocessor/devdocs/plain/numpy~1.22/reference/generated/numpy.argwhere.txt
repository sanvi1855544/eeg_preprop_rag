# numpy.argwhere

numpy.argwhere(a)[source]

    
Find the indices of array elements that are non-zero, grouped by element.

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
Input data.

Returns

    
index_array(N, a.ndim) ndarray

    
Indices of elements that are non-zero. Indices are grouped by element. This
array will have shape `(N, a.ndim)` where `N` is the number of non-zero items.

See also

`where`, `nonzero`

#### Notes

`np.argwhere(a)` is almost the same as `np.transpose(np.nonzero(a))`, but
produces a result of the correct shape for a 0D array.

The output of `argwhere` is not suitable for indexing arrays. For this purpose
use `nonzero(a)` instead.

#### Examples

    
    >>> x = np.arange(6).reshape(2,3)
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> np.argwhere(x>1)
    array([[0, 2],
           [1, 0],
           [1, 1],
           [1, 2]])
