# numpy.polynomial.laguerre.lagadd

polynomial.laguerre.lagadd(c1, c2)[source]

    
Add one Laguerre series to another.

Returns the sum of two Laguerre series `c1` \+ `c2`. The arguments are
sequences of coefficients ordered from lowest order term to highest, i.e.,
[1,2,3] represents the series `P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2`.

Parameters

    
c1, c2array_like

    
1-D arrays of Laguerre series coefficients ordered from low to high.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
Array representing the Laguerre series of their sum.

#### Notes

Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the sum of two Laguerre series is a
Laguerre series (without having to “reproject” the result onto the basis set)
so addition, just like that of “standard” polynomials, is simply “component-
wise.”

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagadd
    >>> lagadd([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4])
    array([2.,  4.,  6.,  4.])
