# numpy.save

numpy.save(file, arr, allow_pickle=True, fix_imports=True)[source]

    
Save an array to a binary file in NumPy `.npy` format.

Parameters

    
filefile, str, or pathlib.Path

    
File or filename to which the data is saved. If file is a file-object, then
the filename is unchanged. If file is a string or Path, a `.npy` extension
will be appended to the filename if it does not already have one.

arrarray_like

    
Array data to be saved.

allow_picklebool, optional

    
Allow saving object arrays using Python pickles. Reasons for disallowing
pickles include security (loading pickled data can execute arbitrary code) and
portability (pickled objects may not be loadable on different Python
installations, for example if the stored objects require libraries that are
not available, and not all pickled data is compatible between Python 2 and
Python 3). Default: True

fix_importsbool, optional

    
Only useful in forcing objects in object arrays on Python 3 to be pickled in a
Python 2 compatible way. If `fix_imports` is True, pickle will try to map the
new Python 3 names to the old module names used in Python 2, so that the
pickle data stream is readable with Python 2.

`savez`

    
Save several arrays into a `.npz` archive

`savetxt`, `load`

#### Notes

For a description of the `.npy` format, see `numpy.lib.format`.

Any data saved to the file is appended to the end of the file.

#### Examples

    
    >>> from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    >>> outfile = TemporaryFile()
    
    
    >>> x = np.arange(10)
    >>> np.save(outfile, x)
    
    
    >>> _ = outfile.seek(0) # Only needed here to simulate closing & reopening file
    >>> np.load(outfile)
    array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    
    
    >>> with open('test.npy', 'wb') as f:
    ...     np.save(f, np.array([1, 2]))
    ...     np.save(f, np.array([1, 3]))
    >>> with open('test.npy', 'rb') as f:
    ...     a = np.load(f)
    ...     b = np.load(f)
    >>> print(a, b)
    # [1 2] [1 3]
