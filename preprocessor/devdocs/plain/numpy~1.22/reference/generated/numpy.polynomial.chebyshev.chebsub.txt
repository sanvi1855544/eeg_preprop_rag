# numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebsub

polynomial.chebyshev.chebsub(c1, c2)[source]

    
Subtract one Chebyshev series from another.

Returns the difference of two Chebyshev series `c1` \- `c2`. The sequences of
coefficients are from lowest order term to highest, i.e., [1,2,3] represents
the series `T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2`.

Parameters

    
c1, c2array_like

    
1-D arrays of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to high.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
Of Chebyshev series coefficients representing their difference.

#### Notes

Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the difference of two Chebyshev series
is a Chebyshev series (without having to “reproject” the result onto the basis
set) so subtraction, just like that of “standard” polynomials, is simply
“component-wise.”

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> C.chebsub(c1,c2)
    array([-2.,  0.,  2.])
    >>> C.chebsub(c2,c1) # -C.chebsub(c1,c2)
    array([ 2.,  0., -2.])
