# numpy.ma.corrcoef

ma.corrcoef(x, y=None, rowvar=True, bias=<no value>, allow_masked=True,
ddof=<no value>)[source]

    
Return Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients.

Except for the handling of missing data this function does the same as
`numpy.corrcoef`. For more details and examples, see `numpy.corrcoef`.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
A 1-D or 2-D array containing multiple variables and observations. Each row of
`x` represents a variable, and each column a single observation of all those
variables. Also see `rowvar` below.

yarray_like, optional

    
An additional set of variables and observations. `y` has the same shape as
`x`.

rowvarbool, optional

    
If `rowvar` is True (default), then each row represents a variable, with
observations in the columns. Otherwise, the relationship is transposed: each
column represents a variable, while the rows contain observations.

bias_NoValue, optional

    
Has no effect, do not use.

Deprecated since version 1.10.0.

allow_maskedbool, optional

    
If True, masked values are propagated pair-wise: if a value is masked in `x`,
the corresponding value is masked in `y`. If False, raises an exception.
Because `bias` is deprecated, this argument needs to be treated as keyword
only to avoid a warning.

ddof_NoValue, optional

    
Has no effect, do not use.

Deprecated since version 1.10.0.

`numpy.corrcoef`

    
Equivalent function in top-level NumPy module.

`cov`

    
Estimate the covariance matrix.

#### Notes

This function accepts but discards arguments `bias` and `ddof`. This is for
backwards compatibility with previous versions of this function. These
arguments had no effect on the return values of the function and can be safely
ignored in this and previous versions of numpy.
