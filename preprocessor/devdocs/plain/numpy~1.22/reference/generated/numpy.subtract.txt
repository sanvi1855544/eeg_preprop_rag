# numpy.subtract

numpy.subtract(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind',
order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'subtract'>

    
Subtract arguments, element-wise.

Parameters

    
x1, x2array_like

    
The arrays to be subtracted from each other. If `x1.shape != x2.shape`, they
must be broadcastable to a common shape (which becomes the shape of the
output).

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
yndarray

    
The difference of `x1` and `x2`, element-wise. This is a scalar if both `x1`
and `x2` are scalars.

#### Notes

Equivalent to `x1 - x2` in terms of array broadcasting.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.subtract(1.0, 4.0)
    -3.0
    
    
    >>> x1 = np.arange(9.0).reshape((3, 3))
    >>> x2 = np.arange(3.0)
    >>> np.subtract(x1, x2)
    array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 3.,  3.,  3.],
           [ 6.,  6.,  6.]])
    
The `-` operator can be used as a shorthand for `np.subtract` on ndarrays.

    
    >>> x1 = np.arange(9.0).reshape((3, 3))
    >>> x2 = np.arange(3.0)
    >>> x1 - x2
    array([[0., 0., 0.],
           [3., 3., 3.],
           [6., 6., 6.]])
