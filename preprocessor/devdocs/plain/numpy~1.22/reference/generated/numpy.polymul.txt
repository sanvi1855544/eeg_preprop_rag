# numpy.polymul

numpy.polymul(a1, a2)[source]

    
Find the product of two polynomials.

Note

This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the new
polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred. A summary of the
differences can be found in the transition guide.

Finds the polynomial resulting from the multiplication of the two input
polynomials. Each input must be either a poly1d object or a 1D sequence of
polynomial coefficients, from highest to lowest degree.

Parameters

    
a1, a2array_like or poly1d object

    
Input polynomials.

Returns

    
outndarray or poly1d object

    
The polynomial resulting from the multiplication of the inputs. If either
inputs is a poly1d object, then the output is also a poly1d object. Otherwise,
it is a 1D array of polynomial coefficients from highest to lowest degree.

`poly1d`

    
A one-dimensional polynomial class.

`convolve`

    
Array convolution. Same output as polymul, but has parameter for overlap mode.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.polymul([1, 2, 3], [9, 5, 1])
    array([ 9, 23, 38, 17,  3])
    
Using poly1d objects:

    
    >>> p1 = np.poly1d([1, 2, 3])
    >>> p2 = np.poly1d([9, 5, 1])
    >>> print(p1)
       2
    1 x + 2 x + 3
    >>> print(p2)
       2
    9 x + 5 x + 1
    >>> print(np.polymul(p1, p2))
       4      3      2
    9 x + 23 x + 38 x + 17 x + 3
