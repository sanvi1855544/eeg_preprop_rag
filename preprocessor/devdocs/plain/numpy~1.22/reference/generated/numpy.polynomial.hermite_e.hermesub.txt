# numpy.polynomial.hermite_e.hermesub

polynomial.hermite_e.hermesub(c1, c2)[source]

    
Subtract one Hermite series from another.

Returns the difference of two Hermite series `c1` \- `c2`. The sequences of
coefficients are from lowest order term to highest, i.e., [1,2,3] represents
the series `P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2`.

Parameters

    
c1, c2array_like

    
1-D arrays of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to high.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
Of Hermite series coefficients representing their difference.

`hermeadd`, `hermemulx`, `hermemul`, `hermediv`, `hermepow`

#### Notes

Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the difference of two Hermite series is
a Hermite series (without having to “reproject” the result onto the basis set)
so subtraction, just like that of “standard” polynomials, is simply
“component-wise.”

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermesub
    >>> hermesub([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3])
    array([0., 0., 0., 4.])
