# numpy.lib.format.write_array

lib.format.write_array(fp, array, version=None, allow_pickle=True,
pickle_kwargs=None)[source]

    
Write an array to an NPY file, including a header.

If the array is neither C-contiguous nor Fortran-contiguous AND the file_like
object is not a real file object, this function will have to copy data in
memory.

Parameters

    
fpfile_like object

    
An open, writable file object, or similar object with a `.write()` method.

arrayndarray

    
The array to write to disk.

version(int, int) or None, optional

    
The version number of the format. None means use the oldest supported version
that is able to store the data. Default: None

allow_picklebool, optional

    
Whether to allow writing pickled data. Default: True

pickle_kwargsdict, optional

    
Additional keyword arguments to pass to pickle.dump, excluding ‘protocol’.
These are only useful when pickling objects in object arrays on Python 3 to
Python 2 compatible format.

Raises

    
ValueError

    
If the array cannot be persisted. This includes the case of allow_pickle=False
and array being an object array.

Various other errors

    
If the array contains Python objects as part of its dtype, the process of
pickling them may raise various errors if the objects are not picklable.
