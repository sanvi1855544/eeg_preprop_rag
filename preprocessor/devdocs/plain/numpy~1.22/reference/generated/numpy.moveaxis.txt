# numpy.moveaxis

numpy.moveaxis(a, source, destination)[source]

    
Move axes of an array to new positions.

Other axes remain in their original order.

New in version 1.11.0.

Parameters

    
anp.ndarray

    
The array whose axes should be reordered.

sourceint or sequence of int

    
Original positions of the axes to move. These must be unique.

destinationint or sequence of int

    
Destination positions for each of the original axes. These must also be
unique.

Returns

    
resultnp.ndarray

    
Array with moved axes. This array is a view of the input array.

See also

`transpose`

    
Permute the dimensions of an array.

`swapaxes`

    
Interchange two axes of an array.

#### Examples

    
    >>> x = np.zeros((3, 4, 5))
    >>> np.moveaxis(x, 0, -1).shape
    (4, 5, 3)
    >>> np.moveaxis(x, -1, 0).shape
    (5, 3, 4)
    
These all achieve the same result:

    
    >>> np.transpose(x).shape
    (5, 4, 3)
    >>> np.swapaxes(x, 0, -1).shape
    (5, 4, 3)
    >>> np.moveaxis(x, [0, 1], [-1, -2]).shape
    (5, 4, 3)
    >>> np.moveaxis(x, [0, 1, 2], [-1, -2, -3]).shape
    (5, 4, 3)
