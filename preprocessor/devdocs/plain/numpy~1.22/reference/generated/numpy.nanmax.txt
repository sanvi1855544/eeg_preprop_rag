# numpy.nanmax

numpy.nanmax(a, axis=None, out=None, keepdims=<no value>, initial=<no value>,
where=<no value>)[source]

    
Return the maximum of an array or maximum along an axis, ignoring any NaNs.
When all-NaN slices are encountered a `RuntimeWarning` is raised and NaN is
returned for that slice.

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
Array containing numbers whose maximum is desired. If `a` is not an array, a
conversion is attempted.

axis{int, tuple of int, None}, optional

    
Axis or axes along which the maximum is computed. The default is to compute
the maximum of the flattened array.

outndarray, optional

    
Alternate output array in which to place the result. The default is `None`; if
provided, it must have the same shape as the expected output, but the type
will be cast if necessary. See Output type determination for more details.

New in version 1.8.0.

keepdimsbool, optional

    
If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as
dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast
correctly against the original `a`.

If the value is anything but the default, then `keepdims` will be passed
through to the `max` method of sub-classes of `ndarray`. If the sub-classes
methods does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.

New in version 1.8.0.

initialscalar, optional

    
The minimum value of an output element. Must be present to allow computation
on empty slice. See `reduce` for details.

New in version 1.22.0.

wherearray_like of bool, optional

    
Elements to compare for the maximum. See `reduce` for details.

New in version 1.22.0.

Returns

    
nanmaxndarray

    
An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified axis removed. If `a`
is a 0-d array, or if axis is None, an ndarray scalar is returned. The same
dtype as `a` is returned.

See also

`nanmin`

    
The minimum value of an array along a given axis, ignoring any NaNs.

`amax`

    
The maximum value of an array along a given axis, propagating any NaNs.

`fmax`

    
Element-wise maximum of two arrays, ignoring any NaNs.

`maximum`

    
Element-wise maximum of two arrays, propagating any NaNs.

`isnan`

    
Shows which elements are Not a Number (NaN).

`isfinite`

    
Shows which elements are neither NaN nor infinity.

`amin`, `fmin`, `minimum`

#### Notes

NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic (IEEE
754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity. Positive
infinity is treated as a very large number and negative infinity is treated as
a very small (i.e. negative) number.

If the input has a integer type the function is equivalent to np.max.

#### Examples

    
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nanmax(a)
    3.0
    >>> np.nanmax(a, axis=0)
    array([3.,  2.])
    >>> np.nanmax(a, axis=1)
    array([2.,  3.])
    
When positive infinity and negative infinity are present:

    
    >>> np.nanmax([1, 2, np.nan, np.NINF])
    2.0
    >>> np.nanmax([1, 2, np.nan, np.inf])
    inf
