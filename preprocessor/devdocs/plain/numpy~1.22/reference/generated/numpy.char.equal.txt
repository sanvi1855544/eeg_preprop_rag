# numpy.char.equal

char.equal(x1, x2)[source]

    
Return (x1 == x2) element-wise.

Unlike `numpy.equal`, this comparison is performed by first stripping
whitespace characters from the end of the string. This behavior is provided
for backward-compatibility with numarray.

Parameters

    
x1, x2array_like of str or unicode

    
Input arrays of the same shape.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
Output array of bools.
