# numpy.logaddexp

numpy.logaddexp(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind',
order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'logaddexp'>

    
Logarithm of the sum of exponentiations of the inputs.

Calculates `log(exp(x1) + exp(x2))`. This function is useful in statistics
where the calculated probabilities of events may be so small as to exceed the
range of normal floating point numbers. In such cases the logarithm of the
calculated probability is stored. This function allows adding probabilities
stored in such a fashion.

Parameters

    
x1, x2array_like

    
Input values. If `x1.shape != x2.shape`, they must be broadcastable to a
common shape (which becomes the shape of the output).

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
resultndarray

    
Logarithm of `exp(x1) + exp(x2)`. This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are
scalars.
