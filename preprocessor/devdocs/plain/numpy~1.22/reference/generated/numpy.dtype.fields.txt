# numpy.dtype.fields

attribute

dtype.fields

    
Dictionary of named fields defined for this data type, or `None`.

The dictionary is indexed by keys that are the names of the fields. Each entry
in the dictionary is a tuple fully describing the field:

    
    (dtype, offset[, title])
    
Offset is limited to C int, which is signed and usually 32 bits. If present,
the optional title can be any object (if it is a string or unicode then it
will also be a key in the fields dictionary, otherwise it’s meta-data). Notice
also that the first two elements of the tuple can be passed directly as
arguments to the `ndarray.getfield` and `ndarray.setfield` methods.

#### Examples

    
    >>> dt = np.dtype([('name', np.str_, 16), ('grades', np.float64, (2,))])
    >>> print(dt.fields)
    {'grades': (dtype(('float64',(2,))), 16), 'name': (dtype('|S16'), 0)}
