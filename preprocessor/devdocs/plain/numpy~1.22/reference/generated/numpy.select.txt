# numpy.select

numpy.select(condlist, choicelist, default=0)[source]

    
Return an array drawn from elements in choicelist, depending on conditions.

Parameters

    
condlistlist of bool ndarrays

    
The list of conditions which determine from which array in `choicelist` the
output elements are taken. When multiple conditions are satisfied, the first
one encountered in `condlist` is used.

choicelistlist of ndarrays

    
The list of arrays from which the output elements are taken. It has to be of
the same length as `condlist`.

defaultscalar, optional

    
The element inserted in `output` when all conditions evaluate to False.

Returns

    
outputndarray

    
The output at position m is the m-th element of the array in `choicelist`
where the m-th element of the corresponding array in `condlist` is True.

See also

`where`

    
Return elements from one of two arrays depending on condition.

`take`, `choose`, `compress`, `diag`, `diagonal`

#### Examples

    
    >>> x = np.arange(6)
    >>> condlist = [x<3, x>3]
    >>> choicelist = [x, x**2]
    >>> np.select(condlist, choicelist, 42)
    array([ 0,  1,  2, 42, 16, 25])
    
    
    >>> condlist = [x<=4, x>3]
    >>> choicelist = [x, x**2]
    >>> np.select(condlist, choicelist, 55)
    array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4, 25])
