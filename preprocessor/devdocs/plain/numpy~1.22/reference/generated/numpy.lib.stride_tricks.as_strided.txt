# numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided

lib.stride_tricks.as_strided(x, shape=None, strides=None, subok=False,
writeable=True)[source]

    
Create a view into the array with the given shape and strides.

Warning

This function has to be used with extreme care, see notes.

Parameters

    
xndarray

    
Array to create a new.

shapesequence of int, optional

    
The shape of the new array. Defaults to `x.shape`.

stridessequence of int, optional

    
The strides of the new array. Defaults to `x.strides`.

subokbool, optional

    
New in version 1.10.

If True, subclasses are preserved.

writeablebool, optional

    
New in version 1.12.

If set to False, the returned array will always be readonly. Otherwise it will
be writable if the original array was. It is advisable to set this to False if
possible (see Notes).

Returns

    
viewndarray

See also

`broadcast_to`

    
broadcast an array to a given shape.

`reshape`

    
reshape an array.

`lib.stride_tricks.sliding_window_view`

    
userfriendly and safe function for the creation of sliding window views.

#### Notes

`as_strided` creates a view into the array given the exact strides and shape.
This means it manipulates the internal data structure of ndarray and, if done
incorrectly, the array elements can point to invalid memory and can corrupt
results or crash your program. It is advisable to always use the original
`x.strides` when calculating new strides to avoid reliance on a contiguous
memory layout.

Furthermore, arrays created with this function often contain self overlapping
memory, so that two elements are identical. Vectorized write operations on
such arrays will typically be unpredictable. They may even give different
results for small, large, or transposed arrays. Since writing to these arrays
has to be tested and done with great care, you may want to use
`writeable=False` to avoid accidental write operations.

For these reasons it is advisable to avoid `as_strided` when possible.
