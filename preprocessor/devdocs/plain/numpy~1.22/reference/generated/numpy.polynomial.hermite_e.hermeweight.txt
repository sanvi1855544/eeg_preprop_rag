# numpy.polynomial.hermite_e.hermeweight

polynomial.hermite_e.hermeweight(x)[source]

    
Weight function of the Hermite_e polynomials.

The weight function is \\(\exp(-x^2/2)\\) and the interval of integration is
\\([-\inf, \inf]\\). the HermiteE polynomials are orthogonal, but not
normalized, with respect to this weight function.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
Values at which the weight function will be computed.

Returns

    
wndarray

    
The weight function at `x`.
