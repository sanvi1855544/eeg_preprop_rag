# numpy.logical_not

numpy.logical_not(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind',
order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc
'logical_not'>

    
Compute the truth value of NOT x element-wise.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
Logical NOT is applied to the elements of `x`.

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
ybool or ndarray of bool

    
Boolean result with the same shape as `x` of the NOT operation on elements of
`x`. This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.logical_not(3)
    False
    >>> np.logical_not([True, False, 0, 1])
    array([False,  True,  True, False])
    
    
    >>> x = np.arange(5)
    >>> np.logical_not(x<3)
    array([False, False, False,  True,  True])
