# numpy.DataSource.abspath

method

DataSource.abspath(path)[source]

    
Return absolute path of file in the DataSource directory.

If `path` is an URL, then `abspath` will return either the location the file
exists locally or the location it would exist when opened using the `open`
method.

Parameters

    
pathstr

    
Can be a local file or a remote URL.

Returns

    
outstr

    
Complete path, including the `DataSource` destination directory.

#### Notes

The functionality is based on `os.path.abspath`.
