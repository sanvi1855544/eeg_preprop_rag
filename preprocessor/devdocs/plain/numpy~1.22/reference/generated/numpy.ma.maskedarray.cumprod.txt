# numpy.ma.MaskedArray.cumprod

method

ma.MaskedArray.cumprod(axis=None, dtype=None, out=None)[source]

    
Return the cumulative product of the array elements over the given axis.

Masked values are set to 1 internally during the computation. However, their
position is saved, and the result will be masked at the same locations.

Refer to `numpy.cumprod` for full documentation.

#### Notes

The mask is lost if `out` is not a valid MaskedArray !

Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is raised on
overflow.
