# numpy.polynomial.hermite_e.hermemul

polynomial.hermite_e.hermemul(c1, c2)[source]

    
Multiply one Hermite series by another.

Returns the product of two Hermite series `c1` * `c2`. The arguments are
sequences of coefficients, from lowest order “term” to highest, e.g., [1,2,3]
represents the series `P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2`.

Parameters

    
c1, c2array_like

    
1-D arrays of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to high.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
Of Hermite series coefficients representing their product.

#### Notes

In general, the (polynomial) product of two C-series results in terms that are
not in the Hermite polynomial basis set. Thus, to express the product as a
Hermite series, it is necessary to “reproject” the product onto said basis
set, which may produce “unintuitive” (but correct) results; see Examples
section below.

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermemul
    >>> hermemul([1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2])
    array([14.,  15.,  28.,   7.,   6.])
