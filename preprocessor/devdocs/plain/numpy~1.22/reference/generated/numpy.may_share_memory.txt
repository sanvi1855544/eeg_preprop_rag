# numpy.may_share_memory

numpy.may_share_memory(a, b, /, max_work=None)

    
Determine if two arrays might share memory

A return of True does not necessarily mean that the two arrays share any
element. It just means that they might.

Only the memory bounds of a and b are checked by default.

Parameters

    
a, bndarray

    
Input arrays

max_workint, optional

    
Effort to spend on solving the overlap problem. See `shares_memory` for
details. Default for `may_share_memory` is to do a bounds check.

Returns

    
outbool

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.may_share_memory(np.array([1,2]), np.array([5,8,9]))
    False
    >>> x = np.zeros([3, 4])
    >>> np.may_share_memory(x[:,0], x[:,1])
    True
