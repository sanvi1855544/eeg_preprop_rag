# numpy.ma.column_stack

ma.column_stack(*args, **kwargs) = <numpy.ma.extras._fromnxfunction_seq
object>

    
Stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.

Take a sequence of 1-D arrays and stack them as columns to make a single 2-D
array. 2-D arrays are stacked as-is, just like with `hstack`. 1-D arrays are
turned into 2-D columns first.

Parameters

    
tupsequence of 1-D or 2-D arrays.

    
Arrays to stack. All of them must have the same first dimension.

Returns

    
stacked2-D array

    
The array formed by stacking the given arrays.

`stack`, `hstack`, `vstack`, `concatenate`

#### Notes

The function is applied to both the _data and the _mask, if any.

#### Examples

    
    >>> a = np.array((1,2,3))
    >>> b = np.array((2,3,4))
    >>> np.column_stack((a,b))
    array([[1, 2],
           [2, 3],
           [3, 4]])
