# numpy.testing.dec.deprecated

testing.dec.deprecated(conditional=True)[source]

    
Deprecated since version 1.21: This decorator is retained for compatibility
with the nose testing framework, which is being phased out. Please use the
nose2 or pytest frameworks instead.

Filter deprecation warnings while running the test suite.

This decorator can be used to filter DeprecationWarning’s, to avoid printing
them during the test suite run, while checking that the test actually raises a
DeprecationWarning.

Parameters

    
conditionalbool or callable, optional

    
Flag to determine whether to mark test as deprecated or not. If the condition
is a callable, it is used at runtime to dynamically make the decision. Default
is True.

Returns

    
decoratorfunction

    
The `deprecated` decorator itself.

#### Notes

New in version 1.4.0.
