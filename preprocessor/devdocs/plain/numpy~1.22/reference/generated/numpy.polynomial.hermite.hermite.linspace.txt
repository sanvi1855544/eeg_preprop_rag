# numpy.polynomial.hermite.Hermite.linspace

method

polynomial.hermite.Hermite.linspace(n=100, domain=None)[source]

    
Return x, y values at equally spaced points in domain.

Returns the x, y values at `n` linearly spaced points across the domain. Here
y is the value of the polynomial at the points x. By default the domain is the
same as that of the series instance. This method is intended mostly as a
plotting aid.

New in version 1.5.0.

Parameters

    
nint, optional

    
Number of point pairs to return. The default value is 100.

domain{None, array_like}, optional

    
If not None, the specified domain is used instead of that of the calling
instance. It should be of the form `[beg,end]`. The default is None which case
the class domain is used.

Returns

    
x, yndarray

    
x is equal to linspace(self.domain[0], self.domain[1], n) and y is the series
evaluated at element of x.
