# numpy.ma.MaskedArray.base

attribute

ma.MaskedArray.base

    
Base object if memory is from some other object.

#### Examples

The base of an array that owns its memory is None:

    
    >>> x = np.array([1,2,3,4])
    >>> x.base is None
    True
    
Slicing creates a view, whose memory is shared with x:

    
    >>> y = x[2:]
    >>> y.base is x
    True
