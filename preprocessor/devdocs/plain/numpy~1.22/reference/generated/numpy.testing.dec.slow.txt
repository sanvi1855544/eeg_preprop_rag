# numpy.testing.dec.slow

testing.dec.slow(t)[source]

    
Deprecated since version 1.21: This decorator is retained for compatibility
with the nose testing framework, which is being phased out. Please use the
nose2 or pytest frameworks instead.

Label a test as ‘slow’.

The exact definition of a slow test is obviously both subjective and hardware-
dependent, but in general any individual test that requires more than a second
or two should be labeled as slow (the whole suite consists of thousands of
tests, so even a second is significant).

Parameters

    
tcallable

    
The test to label as slow.

Returns

    
tcallable

    
The decorated test `t`.

#### Examples

The `numpy.testing` module includes `import decorators as dec`. A test can be
decorated as slow like this:

    
    from numpy.testing import *
    
    @dec.slow
    def test_big(self):
        print('Big, slow test')
