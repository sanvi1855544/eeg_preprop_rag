# numpy.polynomial.hermite.poly2herm

polynomial.hermite.poly2herm(pol)[source]

    
Convert a polynomial to a Hermite series.

Convert an array representing the coefficients of a polynomial (relative to
the “standard” basis) ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an array of
the coefficients of the equivalent Hermite series, ordered from lowest to
highest degree.

Parameters

    
polarray_like

    
1-D array containing the polynomial coefficients

Returns

    
cndarray

    
1-D array containing the coefficients of the equivalent Hermite series.

#### Notes

The easy way to do conversions between polynomial basis sets is to use the
convert method of a class instance.

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite import poly2herm
    >>> poly2herm(np.arange(4))
    array([1.   ,  2.75 ,  0.5  ,  0.375])
