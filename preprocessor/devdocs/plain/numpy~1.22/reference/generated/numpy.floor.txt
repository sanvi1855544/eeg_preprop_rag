# numpy.floor

numpy.floor(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K',
dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'floor'>

    
Return the floor of the input, element-wise.

The floor of the scalar `x` is the largest integer `i`, such that `i <= x`. It
is often denoted as \\(\lfloor x \rfloor\\).

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
Input data.

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
yndarray or scalar

    
The floor of each element in `x`. This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

#### Notes

Some spreadsheet programs calculate the “floor-towards-zero”, where
`floor(-2.5) == -2`. NumPy instead uses the definition of `floor` where
`floor(-2.5) == -3`. The “floor-towards-zero” function is called `fix` in
NumPy.

#### Examples

    
    >>> a = np.array([-1.7, -1.5, -0.2, 0.2, 1.5, 1.7, 2.0])
    >>> np.floor(a)
    array([-2., -2., -1.,  0.,  1.,  1.,  2.])
