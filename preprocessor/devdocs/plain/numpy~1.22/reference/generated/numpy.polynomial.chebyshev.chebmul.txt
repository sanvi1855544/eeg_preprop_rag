# numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebmul

polynomial.chebyshev.chebmul(c1, c2)[source]

    
Multiply one Chebyshev series by another.

Returns the product of two Chebyshev series `c1` * `c2`. The arguments are
sequences of coefficients, from lowest order “term” to highest, e.g., [1,2,3]
represents the series `T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2`.

Parameters

    
c1, c2array_like

    
1-D arrays of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to high.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
Of Chebyshev series coefficients representing their product.

#### Notes

In general, the (polynomial) product of two C-series results in terms that are
not in the Chebyshev polynomial basis set. Thus, to express the product as a
C-series, it is typically necessary to “reproject” the product onto said basis
set, which typically produces “unintuitive live” (but correct) results; see
Examples section below.

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> C.chebmul(c1,c2) # multiplication requires "reprojection"
    array([  6.5,  12. ,  12. ,   4. ,   1.5])
