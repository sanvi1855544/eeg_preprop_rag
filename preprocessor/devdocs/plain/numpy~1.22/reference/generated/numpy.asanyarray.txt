# numpy.asanyarray

numpy.asanyarray(a, dtype=None, order=None, *, like=None)

    
Convert the input to an ndarray, but pass ndarray subclasses through.

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
Input data, in any form that can be converted to an array. This includes
scalars, lists, lists of tuples, tuples, tuples of tuples, tuples of lists,
and ndarrays.

dtypedata-type, optional

    
By default, the data-type is inferred from the input data.

order{‘C’, ‘F’, ‘A’, ‘K’}, optional

    
Memory layout. ‘A’ and ‘K’ depend on the order of input array a. ‘C’ row-major
(C-style), ‘F’ column-major (Fortran-style) memory representation. ‘A’ (any)
means ‘F’ if `a` is Fortran contiguous, ‘C’ otherwise ‘K’ (keep) preserve
input order Defaults to ‘C’.

likearray_like

    
Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not NumPy arrays.
If an array-like passed in as `like` supports the `__array_function__`
protocol, the result will be defined by it. In this case, it ensures the
creation of an array object compatible with that passed in via this argument.

New in version 1.20.0.

Returns

    
outndarray or an ndarray subclass

    
Array interpretation of `a`. If `a` is an ndarray or a subclass of ndarray, it
is returned as-is and no copy is performed.

See also

`asarray`

    
Similar function which always returns ndarrays.

`ascontiguousarray`

    
Convert input to a contiguous array.

`asfarray`

    
Convert input to a floating point ndarray.

`asfortranarray`

    
Convert input to an ndarray with column-major memory order.

`asarray_chkfinite`

    
Similar function which checks input for NaNs and Infs.

`fromiter`

    
Create an array from an iterator.

`fromfunction`

    
Construct an array by executing a function on grid positions.

#### Examples

Convert a list into an array:

    
    >>> a = [1, 2]
    >>> np.asanyarray(a)
    array([1, 2])
    
Instances of `ndarray` subclasses are passed through as-is:

    
    >>> a = np.array([(1.0, 2), (3.0, 4)], dtype='f4,i4').view(np.recarray)
    >>> np.asanyarray(a) is a
    True
