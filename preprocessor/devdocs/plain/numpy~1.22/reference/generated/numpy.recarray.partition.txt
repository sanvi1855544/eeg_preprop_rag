# numpy.recarray.partition

method

recarray.partition(kth, axis=\- 1, kind='introselect', order=None)

    
Rearranges the elements in the array in such a way that the value of the
element in kth position is in the position it would be in a sorted array. All
elements smaller than the kth element are moved before this element and all
equal or greater are moved behind it. The ordering of the elements in the two
partitions is undefined.

New in version 1.8.0.

Parameters

    
kthint or sequence of ints

    
Element index to partition by. The kth element value will be in its final
sorted position and all smaller elements will be moved before it and all equal
or greater elements behind it. The order of all elements in the partitions is
undefined. If provided with a sequence of kth it will partition all elements
indexed by kth of them into their sorted position at once.

Deprecated since version 1.22.0: Passing booleans as index is deprecated.

axisint, optional

    
Axis along which to sort. Default is -1, which means sort along the last axis.

kind{‘introselect’}, optional

    
Selection algorithm. Default is ‘introselect’.

orderstr or list of str, optional

    
When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies which fields
to compare first, second, etc. A single field can be specified as a string,
and not all fields need to be specified, but unspecified fields will still be
used, in the order in which they come up in the dtype, to break ties.
