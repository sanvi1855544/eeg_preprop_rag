# numpy.count_nonzero

numpy.count_nonzero(a, axis=None, *, keepdims=False)[source]

    
Counts the number of non-zero values in the array `a`.

The word “non-zero” is in reference to the Python 2.x built-in method
`__nonzero__()` (renamed `__bool__()` in Python 3.x) of Python objects that
tests an object’s “truthfulness”. For example, any number is considered
truthful if it is nonzero, whereas any string is considered truthful if it is
not the empty string. Thus, this function (recursively) counts how many
elements in `a` (and in sub-arrays thereof) have their `__nonzero__()` or
`__bool__()` method evaluated to `True`.

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
The array for which to count non-zeros.

axisint or tuple, optional

    
Axis or tuple of axes along which to count non-zeros. Default is None, meaning
that non-zeros will be counted along a flattened version of `a`.

New in version 1.12.0.

keepdimsbool, optional

    
If this is set to True, the axes that are counted are left in the result as
dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast
correctly against the input array.

New in version 1.19.0.

Returns

    
countint or array of int

    
Number of non-zero values in the array along a given axis. Otherwise, the
total number of non-zero values in the array is returned.

`nonzero`

    
Return the coordinates of all the non-zero values.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.count_nonzero(np.eye(4))
    4
    >>> a = np.array([[0, 1, 7, 0],
    ...               [3, 0, 2, 19]])
    >>> np.count_nonzero(a)
    5
    >>> np.count_nonzero(a, axis=0)
    array([1, 1, 2, 1])
    >>> np.count_nonzero(a, axis=1)
    array([2, 3])
    >>> np.count_nonzero(a, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    array([[2],
           [3]])
