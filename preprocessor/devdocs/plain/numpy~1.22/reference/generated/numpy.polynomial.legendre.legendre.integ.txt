# numpy.polynomial.legendre.Legendre.integ

method

polynomial.legendre.Legendre.integ(m=1, k=[], lbnd=None)[source]

    
Integrate.

Return a series instance that is the definite integral of the current series.

Parameters

    
mnon-negative int

    
The number of integrations to perform.

karray_like

    
Integration constants. The first constant is applied to the first integration,
the second to the second, and so on. The list of values must less than or
equal to `m` in length and any missing values are set to zero.

lbndScalar

    
The lower bound of the definite integral.

Returns

    
new_seriesseries

    
A new series representing the integral. The domain is the same as the domain
of the integrated series.
