# numpy.recarray.setflags

method

recarray.setflags(write=None, align=None, uic=None)

    
Set array flags WRITEABLE, ALIGNED, (WRITEBACKIFCOPY and UPDATEIFCOPY),
respectively.

These Boolean-valued flags affect how numpy interprets the memory area used by
`a` (see Notes below). The ALIGNED flag can only be set to True if the data is
actually aligned according to the type. The WRITEBACKIFCOPY and (deprecated)
UPDATEIFCOPY flags can never be set to True. The flag WRITEABLE can only be
set to True if the array owns its own memory, or the ultimate owner of the
memory exposes a writeable buffer interface, or is a string. (The exception
for string is made so that unpickling can be done without copying memory.)

Parameters

    
writebool, optional

    
Describes whether or not `a` can be written to.

alignbool, optional

    
Describes whether or not `a` is aligned properly for its type.

uicbool, optional

    
Describes whether or not `a` is a copy of another “base” array.

#### Notes

Array flags provide information about how the memory area used for the array
is to be interpreted. There are 7 Boolean flags in use, only four of which can
be changed by the user: WRITEBACKIFCOPY, UPDATEIFCOPY, WRITEABLE, and ALIGNED.

WRITEABLE (W) the data area can be written to;

ALIGNED (A) the data and strides are aligned appropriately for the hardware
(as determined by the compiler);

UPDATEIFCOPY (U) (deprecated), replaced by WRITEBACKIFCOPY;

WRITEBACKIFCOPY (X) this array is a copy of some other array (referenced by
.base). When the C-API function PyArray_ResolveWritebackIfCopy is called, the
base array will be updated with the contents of this array.

All flags can be accessed using the single (upper case) letter as well as the
full name.

#### Examples

    
    >>> y = np.array([[3, 1, 7],
    ...               [2, 0, 0],
    ...               [8, 5, 9]])
    >>> y
    array([[3, 1, 7],
           [2, 0, 0],
           [8, 5, 9]])
    >>> y.flags
      C_CONTIGUOUS : True
      F_CONTIGUOUS : False
      OWNDATA : True
      WRITEABLE : True
      ALIGNED : True
      WRITEBACKIFCOPY : False
      UPDATEIFCOPY : False
    >>> y.setflags(write=0, align=0)
    >>> y.flags
      C_CONTIGUOUS : True
      F_CONTIGUOUS : False
      OWNDATA : True
      WRITEABLE : False
      ALIGNED : False
      WRITEBACKIFCOPY : False
      UPDATEIFCOPY : False
    >>> y.setflags(uic=1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ValueError: cannot set WRITEBACKIFCOPY flag to True
