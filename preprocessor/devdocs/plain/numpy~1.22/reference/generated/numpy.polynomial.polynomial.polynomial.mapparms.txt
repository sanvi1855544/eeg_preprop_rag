# numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial.mapparms

method

polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial.mapparms()[source]

    
Return the mapping parameters.

The returned values define a linear map `off + scl*x` that is applied to the
input arguments before the series is evaluated. The map depends on the
`domain` and `window`; if the current `domain` is equal to the `window` the
resulting map is the identity. If the coefficients of the series instance are
to be used by themselves outside this class, then the linear function must be
substituted for the `x` in the standard representation of the base
polynomials.

Returns

    
off, sclfloat or complex

    
The mapping function is defined by `off + scl*x`.

#### Notes

If the current domain is the interval `[l1, r1]` and the window is `[l2, r2]`,
then the linear mapping function `L` is defined by the equations:

    
    L(l1) = l2
    L(r1) = r2
