# numpy.lib.scimath.log

lib.scimath.log(x)[source]

    
Compute the natural logarithm of `x`.

Return the “principal value” (for a description of this, see `numpy.log`) of
\\(log_e(x)\\). For real `x > 0`, this is a real number (`log(0)` returns
`-inf` and `log(np.inf)` returns `inf`). Otherwise, the complex principle
value is returned.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
The value(s) whose log is (are) required.

Returns

    
outndarray or scalar

    
The log of the `x` value(s). If `x` was a scalar, so is `out`, otherwise an
array is returned.

`numpy.log`

#### Notes

For a log() that returns `NAN` when real `x < 0`, use `numpy.log` (note,
however, that otherwise `numpy.log` and this `log` are identical, i.e., both
return `-inf` for `x = 0`, `inf` for `x = inf`, and, notably, the complex
principle value if `x.imag != 0`).

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.emath.log(np.exp(1))
    1.0
    
Negative arguments are handled “correctly” (recall that `exp(log(x)) == x`
does not hold for real `x < 0`):

    
    >>> np.emath.log(-np.exp(1)) == (1 + np.pi * 1j)
    True
