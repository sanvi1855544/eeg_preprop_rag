# numpy.polysub

numpy.polysub(a1, a2)[source]

    
Difference (subtraction) of two polynomials.

Note

This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the new
polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred. A summary of the
differences can be found in the transition guide.

Given two polynomials `a1` and `a2`, returns `a1 - a2`. `a1` and `a2` can be
either array_like sequences of the polynomials’ coefficients (including
coefficients equal to zero), or `poly1d` objects.

Parameters

    
a1, a2array_like or poly1d

    
Minuend and subtrahend polynomials, respectively.

Returns

    
outndarray or poly1d

    
Array or `poly1d` object of the difference polynomial’s coefficients.

#### Examples

\\[(2 x^2 + 10 x - 2) - (3 x^2 + 10 x -4) = (-x^2 + 2)\\]
