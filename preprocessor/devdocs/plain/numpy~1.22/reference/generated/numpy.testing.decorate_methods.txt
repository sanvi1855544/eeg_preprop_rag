# numpy.testing.decorate_methods

testing.decorate_methods(cls, decorator, testmatch=None)[source]

    
Apply a decorator to all methods in a class matching a regular expression.

The given decorator is applied to all public methods of `cls` that are matched
by the regular expression `testmatch` (`testmatch.search(methodname)`).
Methods that are private, i.e. start with an underscore, are ignored.

Parameters

    
clsclass

    
Class whose methods to decorate.

decoratorfunction

    
Decorator to apply to methods

testmatchcompiled regexp or str, optional

    
The regular expression. Default value is None, in which case the nose default
(`re.compile(r'(?:^|[\b_\.%s-])[Tt]est' % os.sep)`) is used. If `testmatch` is
a string, it is compiled to a regular expression first.
