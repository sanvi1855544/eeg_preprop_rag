# numpy.polynomial.polynomial.polyvander

polynomial.polynomial.polyvander(x, deg)[source]

    
Vandermonde matrix of given degree.

Returns the Vandermonde matrix of degree `deg` and sample points `x`. The
Vandermonde matrix is defined by

\\[V[..., i] = x^i,\\]

where `0 <= i <= deg`. The leading indices of `V` index the elements of `x`
and the last index is the power of `x`.

If `c` is a 1-D array of coefficients of length `n + 1` and `V` is the matrix
`V = polyvander(x, n)`, then `np.dot(V, c)` and `polyval(x, c)` are the same
up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares fitting and
for the evaluation of a large number of polynomials of the same degree and
sample points.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
Array of points. The dtype is converted to float64 or complex128 depending on
whether any of the elements are complex. If `x` is scalar it is converted to a
1-D array.

degint

    
Degree of the resulting matrix.

Returns

    
vanderndarray.

    
The Vandermonde matrix. The shape of the returned matrix is `x.shape + (deg +
1,)`, where the last index is the power of `x`. The dtype will be the same as
the converted `x`.
