# numpy.testing.assert_raises

testing.assert_raises(exception_class, callable, *args, **kwargs)
assert_raises(exception_class)[source]

testing.assert_raises(exception_class) → None

    
Fail unless an exception of class exception_class is thrown by callable when
invoked with arguments args and keyword arguments kwargs. If a different type
of exception is thrown, it will not be caught, and the test case will be
deemed to have suffered an error, exactly as for an unexpected exception.

Alternatively, `assert_raises` can be used as a context manager:

    
    >>> from numpy.testing import assert_raises
    >>> with assert_raises(ZeroDivisionError):
    ...     1 / 0
    
is equivalent to

    
    >>> def div(x, y):
    ...     return x / y
    >>> assert_raises(ZeroDivisionError, div, 1, 0)
