# numpy.polynomial.laguerre.lagmul

polynomial.laguerre.lagmul(c1, c2)[source]

    
Multiply one Laguerre series by another.

Returns the product of two Laguerre series `c1` * `c2`. The arguments are
sequences of coefficients, from lowest order “term” to highest, e.g., [1,2,3]
represents the series `P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2`.

Parameters

    
c1, c2array_like

    
1-D arrays of Laguerre series coefficients ordered from low to high.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
Of Laguerre series coefficients representing their product.

#### Notes

In general, the (polynomial) product of two C-series results in terms that are
not in the Laguerre polynomial basis set. Thus, to express the product as a
Laguerre series, it is necessary to “reproject” the product onto said basis
set, which may produce “unintuitive” (but correct) results; see Examples
section below.

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagmul
    >>> lagmul([1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2])
    array([  8., -13.,  38., -51.,  36.])
