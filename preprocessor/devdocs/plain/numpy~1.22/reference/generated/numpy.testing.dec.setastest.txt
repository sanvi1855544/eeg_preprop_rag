# numpy.testing.dec.setastest

testing.dec.setastest(tf=True)[source]

    
Deprecated since version 1.21: This decorator is retained for compatibility
with the nose testing framework, which is being phased out. Please use the
nose2 or pytest frameworks instead.

Signals to nose that this function is or is not a test.

Parameters

    
tfbool

    
If True, specifies that the decorated callable is a test. If False, specifies
that the decorated callable is not a test. Default is True.

#### Notes

This decorator can’t use the nose namespace, because it can be called from a
non-test module. See also `istest` and `nottest` in `nose.tools`.

#### Examples

`setastest` can be used in the following way:

    
    from numpy.testing import dec
    
    @dec.setastest(False)
    def func_with_test_in_name(arg1, arg2):
        pass
