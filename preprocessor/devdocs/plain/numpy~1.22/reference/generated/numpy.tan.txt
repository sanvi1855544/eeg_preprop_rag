# numpy.tan

numpy.tan(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K',
dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'tan'>

    
Compute tangent element-wise.

Equivalent to `np.sin(x)/np.cos(x)` element-wise.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
Input array.

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
yndarray

    
The corresponding tangent values. This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

#### Notes

If `out` is provided, the function writes the result into it, and returns a
reference to `out`. (See Examples)

#### Examples

    
    >>> from math import pi
    >>> np.tan(np.array([-pi,pi/2,pi]))
    array([  1.22460635e-16,   1.63317787e+16,  -1.22460635e-16])
    >>>
    >>> # Example of providing the optional output parameter illustrating
    >>> # that what is returned is a reference to said parameter
    >>> out1 = np.array([0], dtype='d')
    >>> out2 = np.cos([0.1], out1)
    >>> out2 is out1
    True
    >>>
    >>> # Example of ValueError due to provision of shape mis-matched `out`
    >>> np.cos(np.zeros((3,3)),np.zeros((2,2)))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (3,3) (2,2)
