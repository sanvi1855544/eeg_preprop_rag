# numpy.ndarray.flatten

method

ndarray.flatten(order='C')

    
Return a copy of the array collapsed into one dimension.

Parameters

    
order{‘C’, ‘F’, ‘A’, ‘K’}, optional

    
‘C’ means to flatten in row-major (C-style) order. ‘F’ means to flatten in
column-major (Fortran- style) order. ‘A’ means to flatten in column-major
order if `a` is Fortran contiguous in memory, row-major order otherwise. ‘K’
means to flatten `a` in the order the elements occur in memory. The default is
‘C’.

Returns

    
yndarray

    
A copy of the input array, flattened to one dimension.

See also

`ravel`

    
Return a flattened array.

`flat`

    
A 1-D flat iterator over the array.

#### Examples

    
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2], [3,4]])
    >>> a.flatten()
    array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> a.flatten('F')
    array([1, 3, 2, 4])
