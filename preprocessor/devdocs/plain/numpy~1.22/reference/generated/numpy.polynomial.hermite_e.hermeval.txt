# numpy.polynomial.hermite_e.hermeval

polynomial.hermite_e.hermeval(x, c, tensor=True)[source]

    
Evaluate an HermiteE series at points x.

If `c` is of length `n + 1`, this function returns the value:

\\[p(x) = c_0 * He_0(x) + c_1 * He_1(x) + ... + c_n * He_n(x)\\]

The parameter `x` is converted to an array only if it is a tuple or a list,
otherwise it is treated as a scalar. In either case, either `x` or its
elements must support multiplication and addition both with themselves and
with the elements of `c`.

If `c` is a 1-D array, then `p(x)` will have the same shape as `x`. If `c` is
multidimensional, then the shape of the result depends on the value of
`tensor`. If `tensor` is true the shape will be c.shape[1:] + x.shape. If
`tensor` is false the shape will be c.shape[1:]. Note that scalars have shape
(,).

Trailing zeros in the coefficients will be used in the evaluation, so they
should be avoided if efficiency is a concern.

Parameters

    
xarray_like, compatible object

    
If `x` is a list or tuple, it is converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
unchanged and treated as a scalar. In either case, `x` or its elements must
support addition and multiplication with with themselves and with the elements
of `c`.

carray_like

    
Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of degree n
are contained in c[n]. If `c` is multidimensional the remaining indices
enumerate multiple polynomials. In the two dimensional case the coefficients
may be thought of as stored in the columns of `c`.

tensorboolean, optional

    
If True, the shape of the coefficient array is extended with ones on the
right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0 for this
action. The result is that every column of coefficients in `c` is evaluated
for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast over the columns of `c`
for the evaluation. This keyword is useful when `c` is multidimensional. The
default value is True.

New in version 1.7.0.

Returns

    
valuesndarray, algebra_like

    
The shape of the return value is described above.

#### Notes

The evaluation uses Clenshaw recursion, aka synthetic division.

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import hermeval
    >>> coef = [1,2,3]
    >>> hermeval(1, coef)
    3.0
    >>> hermeval([[1,2],[3,4]], coef)
    array([[ 3., 14.],
           [31., 54.]])
