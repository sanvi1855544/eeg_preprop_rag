# numpy.isnan

numpy.isnan(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K',
dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'isnan'>

    
Test element-wise for NaN and return result as a boolean array.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
Input array.

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
yndarray or bool

    
True where `x` is NaN, false otherwise. This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

#### Notes

NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic (IEEE
754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.isnan(np.nan)
    True
    >>> np.isnan(np.inf)
    False
    >>> np.isnan([np.log(-1.),1.,np.log(0)])
    array([ True, False, False])
