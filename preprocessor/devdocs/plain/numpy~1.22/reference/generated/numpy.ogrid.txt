# numpy.ogrid

numpy.ogrid = <numpy.lib.index_tricks.OGridClass object>

    
`nd_grid` instance which returns an open multi-dimensional “meshgrid”.

An instance of `numpy.lib.index_tricks.nd_grid` which returns an open (i.e.
not fleshed out) mesh-grid when indexed, so that only one dimension of each
returned array is greater than 1. The dimension and number of the output
arrays are equal to the number of indexing dimensions. If the step length is
not a complex number, then the stop is not inclusive.

However, if the step length is a complex number (e.g. 5j), then the integer
part of its magnitude is interpreted as specifying the number of points to
create between the start and stop values, where the stop value is inclusive.

Returns

    
mesh-grid

    
`ndarrays` with only one dimension not equal to 1

class of `ogrid` and `mgrid` objects

`mgrid`

    
like `ogrid` but returns dense (or fleshed out) mesh grids

`r_`

    
array concatenator

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy import ogrid
    >>> ogrid[-1:1:5j]
    array([-1. , -0.5,  0. ,  0.5,  1. ])
    >>> ogrid[0:5,0:5]
    [array([[0],
            [1],
            [2],
            [3],
            [4]]), array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]])]
