# numpy.logical_xor

numpy.logical_xor(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind',
order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc
'logical_xor'>

    
Compute the truth value of x1 XOR x2, element-wise.

Parameters

    
x1, x2array_like

    
Logical XOR is applied to the elements of `x1` and `x2`. If `x1.shape !=
x2.shape`, they must be broadcastable to a common shape (which becomes the
shape of the output).

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
ybool or ndarray of bool

    
Boolean result of the logical XOR operation applied to the elements of `x1`
and `x2`; the shape is determined by broadcasting. This is a scalar if both
`x1` and `x2` are scalars.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.logical_xor(True, False)
    True
    >>> np.logical_xor([True, True, False, False], [True, False, True, False])
    array([False,  True,  True, False])
    
    
    >>> x = np.arange(5)
    >>> np.logical_xor(x < 1, x > 3)
    array([ True, False, False, False,  True])
    
Simple example showing support of broadcasting

    
    >>> np.logical_xor(0, np.eye(2))
    array([[ True, False],
           [False,  True]])
