# numpy.power

numpy.power(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind',
order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'power'>

    
First array elements raised to powers from second array, element-wise.

Raise each base in `x1` to the positionally-corresponding power in `x2`. `x1`
and `x2` must be broadcastable to the same shape.

An integer type raised to a negative integer power will raise a `ValueError`.

Negative values raised to a non-integral value will return `nan`. To get
complex results, cast the input to complex, or specify the `dtype` to be
`complex` (see the example below).

Parameters

    
x1array_like

    
The bases.

x2array_like

    
The exponents. If `x1.shape != x2.shape`, they must be broadcastable to a
common shape (which becomes the shape of the output).

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
yndarray

    
The bases in `x1` raised to the exponents in `x2`. This is a scalar if both
`x1` and `x2` are scalars.

power function that promotes integers to float

#### Examples

Cube each element in an array.

    
    >>> x1 = np.arange(6)
    >>> x1
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> np.power(x1, 3)
    array([  0,   1,   8,  27,  64, 125])
    
Raise the bases to different exponents.

    
    >>> x2 = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0]
    >>> np.power(x1, x2)
    array([  0.,   1.,   8.,  27.,  16.,   5.])
    
The effect of broadcasting.

    
    >>> x2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]])
    >>> x2
    array([[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1],
           [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]])
    >>> np.power(x1, x2)
    array([[ 0,  1,  8, 27, 16,  5],
           [ 0,  1,  8, 27, 16,  5]])
    
The `**` operator can be used as a shorthand for `np.power` on ndarrays.

    
    >>> x2 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1])
    >>> x1 = np.arange(6)
    >>> x1 ** x2
    array([ 0,  1,  8, 27, 16,  5])
    
Negative values raised to a non-integral value will result in `nan` (and a
warning will be generated).

    
    >>> x3 = np.array([-1.0, -4.0])
    >>> with np.errstate(invalid='ignore'):
    ...     p = np.power(x3, 1.5)
    ...
    >>> p
    array([nan, nan])
    
To get complex results, give the argument `dtype=complex`.

    
    >>> np.power(x3, 1.5, dtype=complex)
    array([-1.83697020e-16-1.j, -1.46957616e-15-8.j])
