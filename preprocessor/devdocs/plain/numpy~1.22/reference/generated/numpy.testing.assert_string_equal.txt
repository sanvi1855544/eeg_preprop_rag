# numpy.testing.assert_string_equal

testing.assert_string_equal(actual, desired)[source]

    
Test if two strings are equal.

If the given strings are equal, `assert_string_equal` does nothing. If they
are not equal, an AssertionError is raised, and the diff between the strings
is shown.

Parameters

    
actualstr

    
The string to test for equality against the expected string.

desiredstr

    
The expected string.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.testing.assert_string_equal('abc', 'abc')
    >>> np.testing.assert_string_equal('abc', 'abcd')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ...
    AssertionError: Differences in strings:
