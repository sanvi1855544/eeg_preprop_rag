# numpy.lib.format.open_memmap

lib.format.open_memmap(filename, mode='r+', dtype=None, shape=None,
fortran_order=False, version=None)[source]

    
Open a .npy file as a memory-mapped array.

This may be used to read an existing file or create a new one.

Parameters

    
filenamestr or path-like

    
The name of the file on disk. This may not be a file-like object.

modestr, optional

    
The mode in which to open the file; the default is ‘r+’. In addition to the
standard file modes, ‘c’ is also accepted to mean “copy on write.” See
`memmap` for the available mode strings.

dtypedata-type, optional

    
The data type of the array if we are creating a new file in “write” mode, if
not, `dtype` is ignored. The default value is None, which results in a data-
type of `float64`.

shapetuple of int

    
The shape of the array if we are creating a new file in “write” mode, in which
case this parameter is required. Otherwise, this parameter is ignored and is
thus optional.

fortran_orderbool, optional

    
Whether the array should be Fortran-contiguous (True) or C-contiguous (False,
the default) if we are creating a new file in “write” mode.

versiontuple of int (major, minor) or None

    
If the mode is a “write” mode, then this is the version of the file format
used to create the file. None means use the oldest supported version that is
able to store the data. Default: None

Returns

    
marraymemmap

    
The memory-mapped array.

Raises

    
ValueError

    
If the data or the mode is invalid.

OSError

    
If the file is not found or cannot be opened correctly.
