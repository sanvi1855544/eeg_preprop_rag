# numpy.place

numpy.place(arr, mask, vals)[source]

    
Change elements of an array based on conditional and input values.

Similar to `np.copyto(arr, vals, where=mask)`, the difference is that `place`
uses the first N elements of `vals`, where N is the number of True values in
`mask`, while `copyto` uses the elements where `mask` is True.

Note that `extract` does the exact opposite of `place`.

Parameters

    
arrndarray

    
Array to put data into.

maskarray_like

    
Boolean mask array. Must have the same size as `a`.

vals1-D sequence

    
Values to put into `a`. Only the first N elements are used, where N is the
number of True values in `mask`. If `vals` is smaller than N, it will be
repeated, and if elements of `a` are to be masked, this sequence must be non-
empty.

#### Examples

    
    >>> arr = np.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
    >>> np.place(arr, arr>2, [44, 55])
    >>> arr
    array([[ 0,  1,  2],
           [44, 55, 44]])
