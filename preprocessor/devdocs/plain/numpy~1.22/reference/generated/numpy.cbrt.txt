# numpy.cbrt

numpy.cbrt(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K',
dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'cbrt'>

    
Return the cube-root of an array, element-wise.

New in version 1.10.0.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
The values whose cube-roots are required.

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
yndarray

    
An array of the same shape as `x`, containing the cube cube-root of each
element in `x`. If `out` was provided, `y` is a reference to it. This is a
scalar if `x` is a scalar.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.cbrt([1,8,27])
    array([ 1.,  2.,  3.])
