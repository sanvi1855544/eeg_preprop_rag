# numpy.DataSource.exists

method

DataSource.exists(path)[source]

    
Test if path exists.

Test if `path` exists as (and in this order):

  * a local file.
  * a remote URL that has been downloaded and stored locally in the `DataSource` directory.
  * a remote URL that has not been downloaded, but is valid and accessible.

Parameters

    
pathstr

    
Can be a local file or a remote URL.

Returns

    
outbool

    
True if `path` exists.

#### Notes

When `path` is an URL, `exists` will return True if it’s either stored locally
in the `DataSource` directory, or is a valid remote URL. `DataSource` does not
discriminate between the two, the file is accessible if it exists in either
location.
