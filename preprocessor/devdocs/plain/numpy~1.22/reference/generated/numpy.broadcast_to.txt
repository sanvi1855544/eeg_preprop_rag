# numpy.broadcast_to

numpy.broadcast_to(array, shape, subok=False)[source]

    
Broadcast an array to a new shape.

Parameters

    
arrayarray_like

    
The array to broadcast.

shapetuple or int

    
The shape of the desired array. A single integer `i` is interpreted as `(i,)`.

subokbool, optional

    
If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise the returned array
will be forced to be a base-class array (default).

Returns

    
broadcastarray

    
A readonly view on the original array with the given shape. It is typically
not contiguous. Furthermore, more than one element of a broadcasted array may
refer to a single memory location.

Raises

    
ValueError

    
If the array is not compatible with the new shape according to NumPy’s
broadcasting rules.
