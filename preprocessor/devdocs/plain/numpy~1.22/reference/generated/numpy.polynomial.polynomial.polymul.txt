# numpy.polynomial.polynomial.polymul

polynomial.polynomial.polymul(c1, c2)[source]

    
Multiply one polynomial by another.

Returns the product of two polynomials `c1` * `c2`. The arguments are
sequences of coefficients, from lowest order term to highest, e.g., [1,2,3]
represents the polynomial `1 + 2*x + 3*x**2.`

Parameters

    
c1, c2array_like

    
1-D arrays of coefficients representing a polynomial, relative to the
“standard” basis, and ordered from lowest order term to highest.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
Of the coefficients of their product.

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> P.polymul(c1,c2)
    array([  3.,   8.,  14.,   8.,   3.])
