# numpy.binary_repr

numpy.binary_repr(num, width=None)[source]

    
Return the binary representation of the input number as a string.

For negative numbers, if width is not given, a minus sign is added to the
front. If width is given, the two’s complement of the number is returned, with
respect to that width.

In a two’s-complement system negative numbers are represented by the two’s
complement of the absolute value. This is the most common method of
representing signed integers on computers [1]. A N-bit two’s-complement system
can represent every integer in the range \\(-2^{N-1}\\) to \\(+2^{N-1}-1\\).

Parameters

    
numint

    
Only an integer decimal number can be used.

widthint, optional

    
The length of the returned string if `num` is positive, or the length of the
two’s complement if `num` is negative, provided that `width` is at least a
sufficient number of bits for `num` to be represented in the designated form.

If the `width` value is insufficient, it will be ignored, and `num` will be
returned in binary (`num` > 0) or two’s complement (`num` < 0) form with its
width equal to the minimum number of bits needed to represent the number in
the designated form. This behavior is deprecated and will later raise an
error.

Deprecated since version 1.12.0.

Returns

    
binstr

    
Binary representation of `num` or two’s complement of `num`.

See also

`base_repr`

    
Return a string representation of a number in the given base system.

`bin`

    
Python’s built-in binary representation generator of an integer.

#### Notes

`binary_repr` is equivalent to using `base_repr` with base 2, but about 25x
faster.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.binary_repr(3)
    '11'
    >>> np.binary_repr(-3)
    '-11'
    >>> np.binary_repr(3, width=4)
    '0011'
    
The two’s complement is returned when the input number is negative and width
is specified:

    
    >>> np.binary_repr(-3, width=3)
    '101'
    >>> np.binary_repr(-3, width=5)
    '11101'
