# numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebadd

polynomial.chebyshev.chebadd(c1, c2)[source]

    
Add one Chebyshev series to another.

Returns the sum of two Chebyshev series `c1` \+ `c2`. The arguments are
sequences of coefficients ordered from lowest order term to highest, i.e.,
[1,2,3] represents the series `T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2`.

Parameters

    
c1, c2array_like

    
1-D arrays of Chebyshev series coefficients ordered from low to high.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
Array representing the Chebyshev series of their sum.

#### Notes

Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the sum of two Chebyshev series is a
Chebyshev series (without having to “reproject” the result onto the basis set)
so addition, just like that of “standard” polynomials, is simply “component-
wise.”

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> C.chebadd(c1,c2)
    array([4., 4., 4.])
