# numpy.ma.round

ma.round(a, decimals=0, out=None)[source]

    
Return a copy of a, rounded to ‘decimals’ places.

When ‘decimals’ is negative, it specifies the number of positions to the left
of the decimal point. The real and imaginary parts of complex numbers are
rounded separately. Nothing is done if the array is not of float type and
‘decimals’ is greater than or equal to 0.

Parameters

    
decimalsint

    
Number of decimals to round to. May be negative.

outarray_like

    
Existing array to use for output. If not given, returns a default copy of a.

#### Notes

If out is given and does not have a mask attribute, the mask of a is lost!
