# numpy.compress

numpy.compress(condition, a, axis=None, out=None)[source]

    
Return selected slices of an array along given axis.

When working along a given axis, a slice along that axis is returned in
`output` for each index where `condition` evaluates to True. When working on a
1-D array, `compress` is equivalent to `extract`.

Parameters

    
condition1-D array of bools

    
Array that selects which entries to return. If len(condition) is less than the
size of `a` along the given axis, then output is truncated to the length of
the condition array.

aarray_like

    
Array from which to extract a part.

axisint, optional

    
Axis along which to take slices. If None (default), work on the flattened
array.

outndarray, optional

    
Output array. Its type is preserved and it must be of the right shape to hold
the output.

Returns

    
compressed_arrayndarray

    
A copy of `a` without the slices along axis for which `condition` is false.

`ndarray.compress`

    
Equivalent method in ndarray

`extract`

    
Equivalent method when working on 1-D arrays

Output type determination

#### Examples

    
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
    >>> a
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4],
           [5, 6]])
    >>> np.compress([0, 1], a, axis=0)
    array([[3, 4]])
    >>> np.compress([False, True, True], a, axis=0)
    array([[3, 4],
           [5, 6]])
    >>> np.compress([False, True], a, axis=1)
    array([[2],
           [4],
           [6]])
    
Working on the flattened array does not return slices along an axis but
selects elements.

    
    >>> np.compress([False, True], a)
    array([2])
