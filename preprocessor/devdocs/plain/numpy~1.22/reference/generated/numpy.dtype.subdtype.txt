# numpy.dtype.subdtype

attribute

dtype.subdtype

    
Tuple `(item_dtype, shape)` if this `dtype` describes a sub-array, and None
otherwise.

The shape is the fixed shape of the sub-array described by this data type, and
item_dtype the data type of the array.

If a field whose dtype object has this attribute is retrieved, then the extra
dimensions implied by shape are tacked on to the end of the retrieved array.

    >>> x = numpy.dtype('8f')
    >>> x.subdtype
    (dtype('float32'), (8,))
    
    
    >>> x =  numpy.dtype('i2')
    >>> x.subdtype
