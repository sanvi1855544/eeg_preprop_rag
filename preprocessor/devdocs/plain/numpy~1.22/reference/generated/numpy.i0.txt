# numpy.i0

numpy.i0(x)[source]

    
Modified Bessel function of the first kind, order 0.

Usually denoted \\(I_0\\).

Parameters

    
xarray_like of float

    
Argument of the Bessel function.

Returns

    
outndarray, shape = x.shape, dtype = float

    
The modified Bessel function evaluated at each of the elements of `x`.

#### Notes

The scipy implementation is recommended over this function: it is a proper
ufunc written in C, and more than an order of magnitude faster.

We use the algorithm published by Clenshaw [1] and referenced by Abramowitz
and Stegun [2], for which the function domain is partitioned into the two
intervals [0,8] and (8,inf), and Chebyshev polynomial expansions are employed
in each interval. Relative error on the domain [0,30] using IEEE arithmetic is
documented [3] as having a peak of 5.8e-16 with an rms of 1.4e-16 (n = 30000).
