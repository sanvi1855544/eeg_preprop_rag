# numpy.logaddexp2

numpy.logaddexp2(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind',
order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'logaddexp2'>

    
Logarithm of the sum of exponentiations of the inputs in base-2.

Calculates `log2(2**x1 + 2**x2)`. This function is useful in machine learning
when the calculated probabilities of events may be so small as to exceed the
range of normal floating point numbers. In such cases the base-2 logarithm of
the calculated probability can be used instead. This function allows adding
probabilities stored in such a fashion.

Parameters

    
x1, x2array_like

    
Input values. If `x1.shape != x2.shape`, they must be broadcastable to a
common shape (which becomes the shape of the output).

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
resultndarray

    
Base-2 logarithm of `2**x1 + 2**x2`. This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2`
are scalars.
