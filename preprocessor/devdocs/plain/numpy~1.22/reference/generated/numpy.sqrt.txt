# numpy.sqrt

numpy.sqrt(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K',
dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'sqrt'>

    
Return the non-negative square-root of an array, element-wise.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
The values whose square-roots are required.

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
yndarray

    
An array of the same shape as `x`, containing the positive square-root of each
element in `x`. If any element in `x` is complex, a complex array is returned
(and the square-roots of negative reals are calculated). If all of the
elements in `x` are real, so is `y`, with negative elements returning `nan`.
If `out` was provided, `y` is a reference to it. This is a scalar if `x` is a
scalar.

`lib.scimath.sqrt`

    
A version which returns complex numbers when given negative reals.

#### Notes

sqrt has–consistent with common convention–as its branch cut the real
“interval” [`-inf`, 0), and is continuous from above on it. A branch cut is a
curve in the complex plane across which a given complex function fails to be
continuous.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.sqrt([1,4,9])
    array([ 1.,  2.,  3.])
    
    
    >>> np.sqrt([4, -1, -3+4J])
    array([ 2.+0.j,  0.+1.j,  1.+2.j])
    
    
    >>> np.sqrt([4, -1, np.inf])
    array([ 2., nan, inf])
