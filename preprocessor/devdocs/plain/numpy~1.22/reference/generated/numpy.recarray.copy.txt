# numpy.recarray.copy

method

recarray.copy(order='C')

    
Return a copy of the array.

Parameters

    
order{‘C’, ‘F’, ‘A’, ‘K’}, optional

    
Controls the memory layout of the copy. ‘C’ means C-order, ‘F’ means F-order,
‘A’ means ‘F’ if `a` is Fortran contiguous, ‘C’ otherwise. ‘K’ means match the
layout of `a` as closely as possible. (Note that this function and
`numpy.copy` are very similar but have different default values for their
order= arguments, and this function always passes sub-classes through.)

`numpy.copyto`

#### Notes

This function is the preferred method for creating an array copy. The function
`numpy.copy` is similar, but it defaults to using order ‘K’, and will not pass
sub-classes through by default.

#### Examples

    
    >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], order='F')
    
    
    >>> y = x.copy()
    
    
    >>> x.fill(0)
    
    
    >>> x
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0]])
    
    
    >>> y
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    
    
    >>> y.flags['C_CONTIGUOUS']
    True
