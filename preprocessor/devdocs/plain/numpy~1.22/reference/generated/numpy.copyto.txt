# numpy.copyto

numpy.copyto(dst, src, casting='same_kind', where=True)

    
Copies values from one array to another, broadcasting as necessary.

Raises a TypeError if the `casting` rule is violated, and if `where` is
provided, it selects which elements to copy.

New in version 1.7.0.

Parameters

    
dstndarray

    
The array into which values are copied.

srcarray_like

    
The array from which values are copied.

casting{‘no’, ‘equiv’, ‘safe’, ‘same_kind’, ‘unsafe’}, optional

    
Controls what kind of data casting may occur when copying.

  * ‘no’ means the data types should not be cast at all.
  * ‘equiv’ means only byte-order changes are allowed.
  * ‘safe’ means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
  * ‘same_kind’ means only safe casts or casts within a kind, like float64 to float32, are allowed.
  * ‘unsafe’ means any data conversions may be done.

wherearray_like of bool, optional

    
A boolean array which is broadcasted to match the dimensions of `dst`, and
selects elements to copy from `src` to `dst` wherever it contains the value
True.
