# numpy.testing.dec.skipif

testing.dec.skipif(skip_condition, msg=None)[source]

    
Deprecated since version 1.21: This decorator is retained for compatibility
with the nose testing framework, which is being phased out. Please use the
nose2 or pytest frameworks instead.

Make function raise SkipTest exception if a given condition is true.

If the condition is a callable, it is used at runtime to dynamically make the
decision. This is useful for tests that may require costly imports, to delay
the cost until the test suite is actually executed.

Parameters

    
skip_conditionbool or callable

    
Flag to determine whether to skip the decorated test.

msgstr, optional

    
Message to give on raising a SkipTest exception. Default is None.

Returns

    
decoratorfunction

    
Decorator which, when applied to a function, causes SkipTest to be raised when
`skip_condition` is True, and the function to be called normally otherwise.

#### Notes

The decorator itself is decorated with the `nose.tools.make_decorator`
function in order to transmit function name, and various other metadata.
