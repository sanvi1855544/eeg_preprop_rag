# numpy.distutils.ccompiler_opt

Provides the `CCompilerOpt` class, used for handling the CPU/hardware
optimization, starting from parsing the command arguments, to managing the
relation between the CPU baseline and dispatch-able features, also generating
the required C headers and ending with compiling the sources with proper
compiler’s flags.

`CCompilerOpt` doesn’t provide runtime detection for the CPU features, instead
only focuses on the compiler side, but it creates abstract C headers that can
be used later for the final runtime dispatching process.

#### Functions

`new_ccompiler_opt`(compiler, dispatch_hpath, ...) | Create a new instance of 'CCompilerOpt' and generate the dispatch header which contains the #definitions and headers of platform-specific instruction-sets for the enabled CPU baseline and dispatch-able features.

#### Classes

`CCompilerOpt`(ccompiler[, cpu_baseline, ...]) | A helper class for `CCompiler` aims to provide extra build options to effectively control of compiler optimizations that are directly related to CPU features.
