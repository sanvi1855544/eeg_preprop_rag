# numpy.polyadd

numpy.polyadd(a1, a2)[source]

    
Find the sum of two polynomials.

Note

This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the new
polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred. A summary of the
differences can be found in the transition guide.

Returns the polynomial resulting from the sum of two input polynomials. Each
input must be either a poly1d object or a 1D sequence of polynomial
coefficients, from highest to lowest degree.

Parameters

    
a1, a2array_like or poly1d object

    
Input polynomials.

Returns

    
outndarray or poly1d object

    
The sum of the inputs. If either input is a poly1d object, then the output is
also a poly1d object. Otherwise, it is a 1D array of polynomial coefficients
from highest to lowest degree.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.polyadd([1, 2], [9, 5, 4])
    array([9, 6, 6])
    
Using poly1d objects:

    
    >>> p1 = np.poly1d([1, 2])
    >>> p2 = np.poly1d([9, 5, 4])
    >>> print(p1)
    1 x + 2
    >>> print(p2)
       2
    9 x + 5 x + 4
    >>> print(np.polyadd(p1, p2))
       2
    9 x + 6 x + 6
