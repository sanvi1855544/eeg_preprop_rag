# numpy.polynomial.polyutils.trimseq

polynomial.polyutils.trimseq(seq)[source]

    
Remove small Poly series coefficients.

Parameters

    
seqsequence

    
Sequence of Poly series coefficients. This routine fails for empty sequences.

Returns

    
seriessequence

    
Subsequence with trailing zeros removed. If the resulting sequence would be
empty, return the first element. The returned sequence may or may not be a
view.
