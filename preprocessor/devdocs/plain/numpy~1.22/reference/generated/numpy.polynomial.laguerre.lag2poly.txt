# numpy.polynomial.laguerre.lag2poly

polynomial.laguerre.lag2poly(c)[source]

    
Convert a Laguerre series to a polynomial.

Convert an array representing the coefficients of a Laguerre series, ordered
from lowest degree to highest, to an array of the coefficients of the
equivalent polynomial (relative to the “standard” basis) ordered from lowest
to highest degree.

Parameters

    
carray_like

    
1-D array containing the Laguerre series coefficients, ordered from lowest
order term to highest.

Returns

    
polndarray

    
1-D array containing the coefficients of the equivalent polynomial (relative
to the “standard” basis) ordered from lowest order term to highest.

#### Notes

The easy way to do conversions between polynomial basis sets is to use the
convert method of a class instance.

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lag2poly
    >>> lag2poly([ 23., -63.,  58., -18.])
    array([0., 1., 2., 3.])
