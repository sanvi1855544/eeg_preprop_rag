# numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.Chebyshev.basis

method

classmethod polynomial.chebyshev.Chebyshev.basis(deg, domain=None,
window=None)[source]

    
Series basis polynomial of degree `deg`.

Returns the series representing the basis polynomial of degree `deg`.

New in version 1.7.0.

Parameters

    
degint

    
Degree of the basis polynomial for the series. Must be >= 0.

domain{None, array_like}, optional

    
If given, the array must be of the form `[beg, end]`, where `beg` and `end`
are the endpoints of the domain. If None is given then the class domain is
used. The default is None.

window{None, array_like}, optional

    
If given, the resulting array must be if the form `[beg, end]`, where `beg`
and `end` are the endpoints of the window. If None is given then the class
window is used. The default is None.

Returns

    
new_seriesseries

    
A series with the coefficient of the `deg` term set to one and all others
zero.
