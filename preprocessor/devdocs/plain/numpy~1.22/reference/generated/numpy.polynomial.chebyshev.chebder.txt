# numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebder

polynomial.chebyshev.chebder(c, m=1, scl=1, axis=0)[source]

    
Differentiate a Chebyshev series.

Returns the Chebyshev series coefficients `c` differentiated `m` times along
`axis`. At each iteration the result is multiplied by `scl` (the scaling
factor is for use in a linear change of variable). The argument `c` is an
array of coefficients from low to high degree along each axis, e.g., [1,2,3]
represents the series `1*T_0 + 2*T_1 + 3*T_2` while [[1,2],[1,2]] represents
`1*T_0(x)*T_0(y) + 1*T_1(x)*T_0(y) + 2*T_0(x)*T_1(y) + 2*T_1(x)*T_1(y)` if
axis=0 is `x` and axis=1 is `y`.

Parameters

    
carray_like

    
Array of Chebyshev series coefficients. If c is multidimensional the different
axis correspond to different variables with the degree in each axis given by
the corresponding index.

mint, optional

    
Number of derivatives taken, must be non-negative. (Default: 1)

sclscalar, optional

    
Each differentiation is multiplied by `scl`. The end result is multiplication
by `scl**m`. This is for use in a linear change of variable. (Default: 1)

axisint, optional

    
Axis over which the derivative is taken. (Default: 0).

New in version 1.7.0.

Returns

    
derndarray

    
Chebyshev series of the derivative.

#### Notes

In general, the result of differentiating a C-series needs to be “reprojected”
onto the C-series basis set. Thus, typically, the result of this function is
“unintuitive,” albeit correct; see Examples section below.

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import chebyshev as C
    >>> c = (1,2,3,4)
    >>> C.chebder(c)
    array([14., 12., 24.])
    >>> C.chebder(c,3)
    array([96.])
    >>> C.chebder(c,scl=-1)
    array([-14., -12., -24.])
    >>> C.chebder(c,2,-1)
    array([12.,  96.])
