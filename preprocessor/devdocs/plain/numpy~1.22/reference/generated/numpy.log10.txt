# numpy.log10

numpy.log10(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K',
dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'log10'>

    
Return the base 10 logarithm of the input array, element-wise.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
Input values.

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
yndarray

    
The logarithm to the base 10 of `x`, element-wise. NaNs are returned where x
is negative. This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

#### Notes

Logarithm is a multivalued function: for each `x` there is an infinite number
of `z` such that `10**z = x`. The convention is to return the `z` whose
imaginary part lies in `[-pi, pi]`.

For real-valued input data types, `log10` always returns real output. For each
value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it yields `nan`
and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.

For complex-valued input, `log10` is a complex analytical function that has a
branch cut `[-inf, 0]` and is continuous from above on it. `log10` handles the
floating-point negative zero as an infinitesimal negative number, conforming
to the C99 standard.
