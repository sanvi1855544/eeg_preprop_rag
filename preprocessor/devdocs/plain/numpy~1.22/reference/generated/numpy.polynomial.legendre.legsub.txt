# numpy.polynomial.legendre.legsub

polynomial.legendre.legsub(c1, c2)[source]

    
Subtract one Legendre series from another.

Returns the difference of two Legendre series `c1` \- `c2`. The sequences of
coefficients are from lowest order term to highest, i.e., [1,2,3] represents
the series `P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2`.

Parameters

    
c1, c2array_like

    
1-D arrays of Legendre series coefficients ordered from low to high.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
Of Legendre series coefficients representing their difference.

`legadd`, `legmulx`, `legmul`, `legdiv`, `legpow`

#### Notes

Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the difference of two Legendre series
is a Legendre series (without having to “reproject” the result onto the basis
set) so subtraction, just like that of “standard” polynomials, is simply
“component-wise.”

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial import legendre as L
    >>> c1 = (1,2,3)
    >>> c2 = (3,2,1)
    >>> L.legsub(c1,c2)
    array([-2.,  0.,  2.])
    >>> L.legsub(c2,c1) # -C.legsub(c1,c2)
    array([ 2.,  0., -2.])
