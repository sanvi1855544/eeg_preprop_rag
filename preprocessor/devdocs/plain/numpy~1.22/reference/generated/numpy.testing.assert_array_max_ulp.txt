# numpy.testing.assert_array_max_ulp

testing.assert_array_max_ulp(a, b, maxulp=1, dtype=None)[source]

    
Check that all items of arrays differ in at most N Units in the Last Place.

Parameters

    
a, barray_like

    
Input arrays to be compared.

maxulpint, optional

    
The maximum number of units in the last place that elements of `a` and `b` can
differ. Default is 1.

dtypedtype, optional

    
Data-type to convert `a` and `b` to if given. Default is None.

Returns

    
retndarray

    
Array containing number of representable floating point numbers between items
in `a` and `b`.

Raises

    
AssertionError

    
If one or more elements differ by more than `maxulp`.

See also

`assert_array_almost_equal_nulp`

    
Compare two arrays relatively to their spacing.

#### Notes

For computing the ULP difference, this API does not differentiate between
various representations of NAN (ULP difference between 0x7fc00000 and
0xffc00000 is zero).

#### Examples

    
    >>> a = np.linspace(0., 1., 100)
    >>> res = np.testing.assert_array_max_ulp(a, np.arcsin(np.sin(a)))
