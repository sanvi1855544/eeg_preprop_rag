# numpy.ma.min

ma.min(obj, axis=None, out=None, fill_value=None, keepdims=<no value>)[source]

    
Return the minimum along a given axis.

Parameters

    
axis{None, int}, optional

    
Axis along which to operate. By default, `axis` is None and the flattened
input is used.

outarray_like, optional

    
Alternative output array in which to place the result. Must be of the same
shape and buffer length as the expected output.

fill_valuescalar or None, optional

    
Value used to fill in the masked values. If None, use the output of
`minimum_fill_value`.

keepdimsbool, optional

    
If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as
dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast
correctly against the array.

Returns

    
aminarray_like

    
New array holding the result. If `out` was specified, `out` is returned.
