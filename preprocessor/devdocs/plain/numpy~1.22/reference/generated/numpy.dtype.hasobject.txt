# numpy.dtype.hasobject

attribute

dtype.hasobject

    
Boolean indicating whether this dtype contains any reference-counted objects
in any fields or sub-dtypes.

Recall that what is actually in the ndarray memory representing the Python
object is the memory address of that object (a pointer). Special handling may
be required, and this attribute is useful for distinguishing data types that
may contain arbitrary Python objects and data-types that won’t.
