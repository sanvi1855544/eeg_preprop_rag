# numpy.nancumprod

numpy.nancumprod(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None)[source]

    
Return the cumulative product of array elements over a given axis treating Not
a Numbers (NaNs) as one. The cumulative product does not change when NaNs are
encountered and leading NaNs are replaced by ones.

Ones are returned for slices that are all-NaN or empty.

New in version 1.12.0.

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
Input array.

axisint, optional

    
Axis along which the cumulative product is computed. By default the input is
flattened.

dtypedtype, optional

    
Type of the returned array, as well as of the accumulator in which the
elements are multiplied. If dtype is not specified, it defaults to the dtype
of `a`, unless `a` has an integer dtype with a precision less than that of the
default platform integer. In that case, the default platform integer is used
instead.

outndarray, optional

    
Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have the same
shape and buffer length as the expected output but the type of the resulting
values will be cast if necessary.

Returns

    
nancumprodndarray

    
A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is specified, in which
case it is returned.

`numpy.cumprod`

    
Cumulative product across array propagating NaNs.

`isnan`

    
Show which elements are NaN.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.nancumprod(1)
    array([1])
    >>> np.nancumprod([1])
    array([1])
    >>> np.nancumprod([1, np.nan])
    array([1.,  1.])
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nancumprod(a)
    array([1.,  2.,  6.,  6.])
    >>> np.nancumprod(a, axis=0)
    array([[1.,  2.],
           [3.,  2.]])
    >>> np.nancumprod(a, axis=1)
    array([[1.,  2.],
           [3.,  3.]])
