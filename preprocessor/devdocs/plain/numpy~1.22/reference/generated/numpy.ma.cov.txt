# numpy.ma.cov

ma.cov(x, y=None, rowvar=True, bias=False, allow_masked=True,
ddof=None)[source]

    
Estimate the covariance matrix.

Except for the handling of missing data this function does the same as
`numpy.cov`. For more details and examples, see `numpy.cov`.

By default, masked values are recognized as such. If `x` and `y` have the same
shape, a common mask is allocated: if `x[i,j]` is masked, then `y[i,j]` will
also be masked. Setting `allow_masked` to False will raise an exception if
values are missing in either of the input arrays.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
A 1-D or 2-D array containing multiple variables and observations. Each row of
`x` represents a variable, and each column a single observation of all those
variables. Also see `rowvar` below.

yarray_like, optional

    
An additional set of variables and observations. `y` has the same shape as
`x`.

rowvarbool, optional

    
If `rowvar` is True (default), then each row represents a variable, with
observations in the columns. Otherwise, the relationship is transposed: each
column represents a variable, while the rows contain observations.

biasbool, optional

    
Default normalization (False) is by `(N-1)`, where `N` is the number of
observations given (unbiased estimate). If `bias` is True, then normalization
is by `N`. This keyword can be overridden by the keyword `ddof` in numpy
versions >= 1.5.

allow_maskedbool, optional

    
If True, masked values are propagated pair-wise: if a value is masked in `x`,
the corresponding value is masked in `y`. If False, raises a `ValueError`
exception when some values are missing.

ddof{None, int}, optional

    
If not `None` normalization is by `(N - ddof)`, where `N` is the number of
observations; this overrides the value implied by `bias`. The default value is
`None`.

New in version 1.5.

Raises

    
ValueError

    
Raised if some values are missing and `allow_masked` is False.
