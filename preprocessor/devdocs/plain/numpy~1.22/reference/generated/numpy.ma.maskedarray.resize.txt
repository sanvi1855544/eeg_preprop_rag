# numpy.ma.MaskedArray.resize

method

ma.MaskedArray.resize(newshape, refcheck=True, order=False)[source]

    
Warning

This method does nothing, except raise a ValueError exception. A masked array
does not own its data and therefore cannot safely be resized in place. Use the
`numpy.ma.resize` function instead.

This method is difficult to implement safely and may be deprecated in future
releases of NumPy.
