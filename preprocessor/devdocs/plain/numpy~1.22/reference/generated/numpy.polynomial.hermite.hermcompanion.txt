# numpy.polynomial.hermite.hermcompanion

polynomial.hermite.hermcompanion(c)[source]

    
Return the scaled companion matrix of c.

The basis polynomials are scaled so that the companion matrix is symmetric
when `c` is an Hermite basis polynomial. This provides better eigenvalue
estimates than the unscaled case and for basis polynomials the eigenvalues are
guaranteed to be real if `numpy.linalg.eigvalsh` is used to obtain them.

Parameters

    
carray_like

    
1-D array of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to high degree.

Returns

    
matndarray

    
Scaled companion matrix of dimensions (deg, deg).
