# numpy.union1d

numpy.union1d(ar1, ar2)[source]

    
Find the union of two arrays.

Return the unique, sorted array of values that are in either of the two input
arrays.

Parameters

    
ar1, ar2array_like

    
Input arrays. They are flattened if they are not already 1D.

Returns

    
union1dndarray

    
Unique, sorted union of the input arrays.

Module with a number of other functions for performing set operations on
arrays.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.union1d([-1, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 2])
    array([-2, -1,  0,  1,  2])
    
To find the union of more than two arrays, use functools.reduce:

    
    >>> from functools import reduce
    >>> reduce(np.union1d, ([1, 3, 4, 3], [3, 1, 2, 1], [6, 3, 4, 2]))
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 6])
