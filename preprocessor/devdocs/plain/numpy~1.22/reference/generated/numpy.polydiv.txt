# numpy.polydiv

numpy.polydiv(u, v)[source]

    
Returns the quotient and remainder of polynomial division.

Note

This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the new
polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred. A summary of the
differences can be found in the transition guide.

The input arrays are the coefficients (including any coefficients equal to
zero) of the “numerator” (dividend) and “denominator” (divisor) polynomials,
respectively.

Parameters

    
uarray_like or poly1d

    
Dividend polynomial’s coefficients.

varray_like or poly1d

    
Divisor polynomial’s coefficients.

Returns

    
qndarray

    
Coefficients, including those equal to zero, of the quotient.

rndarray

    
Coefficients, including those equal to zero, of the remainder.

#### Notes

Both `u` and `v` must be 0-d or 1-d (ndim = 0 or 1), but `u.ndim` need not
equal `v.ndim`. In other words, all four possible combinations - `u.ndim =
v.ndim = 0`, `u.ndim = v.ndim = 1`, `u.ndim = 1, v.ndim = 0`, and `u.ndim = 0,
v.ndim = 1` \- work.

#### Examples

\\[\frac{3x^2 + 5x + 2}{2x + 1} = 1.5x + 1.75, remainder 0.25\\]

    
    >>> x = np.array([3.0, 5.0, 2.0])
    >>> y = np.array([2.0, 1.0])
    >>> np.polydiv(x, y)
    (array([1.5 , 1.75]), array([0.25]))
