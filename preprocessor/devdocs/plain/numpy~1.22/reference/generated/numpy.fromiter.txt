# numpy.fromiter

numpy.fromiter(iter, dtype, count=\- 1, *, like=None)

    
Create a new 1-dimensional array from an iterable object.

Parameters

    
iteriterable object

    
An iterable object providing data for the array.

dtypedata-type

    
The data-type of the returned array.

countint, optional

    
The number of items to read from iterable. The default is -1, which means all
data is read.

likearray_like

    
Reference object to allow the creation of arrays which are not NumPy arrays.
If an array-like passed in as `like` supports the `__array_function__`
protocol, the result will be defined by it. In this case, it ensures the
creation of an array object compatible with that passed in via this argument.

New in version 1.20.0.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
The output array.

#### Notes

Specify `count` to improve performance. It allows `fromiter` to pre-allocate
the output array, instead of resizing it on demand.

#### Examples

    
    >>> iterable = (x*x for x in range(5))
    >>> np.fromiter(iterable, float)
    array([  0.,   1.,   4.,   9.,  16.])
