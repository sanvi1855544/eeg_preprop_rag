# numpy.get_include

numpy.get_include()[source]

    
Return the directory that contains the NumPy *.h header files.

Extension modules that need to compile against NumPy should use this function
to locate the appropriate include directory.

#### Notes

When using `distutils`, for example in `setup.py`.

    
    import numpy as np
    ...
    Extension('extension_name', ...
            include_dirs=[np.get_include()])
    ...
