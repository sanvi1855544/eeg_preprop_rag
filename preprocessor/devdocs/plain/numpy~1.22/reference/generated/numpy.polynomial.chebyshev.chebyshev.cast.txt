# numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.Chebyshev.cast

method

classmethod polynomial.chebyshev.Chebyshev.cast(series, domain=None,
window=None)[source]

    
Convert series to series of this class.

The `series` is expected to be an instance of some polynomial series of one of
the types supported by by the numpy.polynomial module, but could be some other
class that supports the convert method.

New in version 1.7.0.

Parameters

    
seriesseries

    
The series instance to be converted.

domain{None, array_like}, optional

    
If given, the array must be of the form `[beg, end]`, where `beg` and `end`
are the endpoints of the domain. If None is given then the class domain is
used. The default is None.

window{None, array_like}, optional

    
If given, the resulting array must be if the form `[beg, end]`, where `beg`
and `end` are the endpoints of the window. If None is given then the class
window is used. The default is None.

Returns

    
new_seriesseries

    
A series of the same kind as the calling class and equal to `series` when
evaluated.
