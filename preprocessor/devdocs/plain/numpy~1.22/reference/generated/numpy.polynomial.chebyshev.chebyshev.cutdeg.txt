# numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.Chebyshev.cutdeg

method

polynomial.chebyshev.Chebyshev.cutdeg(deg)[source]

    
Truncate series to the given degree.

Reduce the degree of the series to `deg` by discarding the high order terms.
If `deg` is greater than the current degree a copy of the current series is
returned. This can be useful in least squares where the coefficients of the
high degree terms may be very small.

New in version 1.5.0.

Parameters

    
degnon-negative int

    
The series is reduced to degree `deg` by discarding the high order terms. The
value of `deg` must be a non-negative integer.

Returns

    
new_seriesseries

    
New instance of series with reduced degree.
