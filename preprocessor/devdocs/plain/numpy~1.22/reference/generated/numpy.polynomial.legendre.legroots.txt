# numpy.polynomial.legendre.legroots

polynomial.legendre.legroots(c)[source]

    
Compute the roots of a Legendre series.

Return the roots (a.k.a. “zeros”) of the polynomial

\\[p(x) = \sum_i c[i] * L_i(x).\\]

Parameters

    
c1-D array_like

    
1-D array of coefficients.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
Array of the roots of the series. If all the roots are real, then `out` is
also real, otherwise it is complex.

#### Notes

The root estimates are obtained as the eigenvalues of the companion matrix,
Roots far from the origin of the complex plane may have large errors due to
the numerical instability of the series for such values. Roots with
multiplicity greater than 1 will also show larger errors as the value of the
series near such points is relatively insensitive to errors in the roots.
Isolated roots near the origin can be improved by a few iterations of Newton’s
method.

The Legendre series basis polynomials aren’t powers of `x` so the results of
this function may seem unintuitive.

#### Examples

    
    >>> import numpy.polynomial.legendre as leg
    >>> leg.legroots((1, 2, 3, 4)) # 4L_3 + 3L_2 + 2L_1 + 1L_0, all real roots
    array([-0.85099543, -0.11407192,  0.51506735]) # may vary
