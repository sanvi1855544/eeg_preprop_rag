# numpy.polynomial.hermite.hermpow

polynomial.hermite.hermpow(c, pow, maxpower=16)[source]

    
Raise a Hermite series to a power.

Returns the Hermite series `c` raised to the power `pow`. The argument `c` is
a sequence of coefficients ordered from low to high. i.e., [1,2,3] is the
series `P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2.`

Parameters

    
carray_like

    
1-D array of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to high.

powinteger

    
Power to which the series will be raised

maxpowerinteger, optional

    
Maximum power allowed. This is mainly to limit growth of the series to
unmanageable size. Default is 16

Returns

    
coefndarray

    
Hermite series of power.
