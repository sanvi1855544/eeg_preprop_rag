# numpy.polynomial.chebyshev.chebvander

polynomial.chebyshev.chebvander(x, deg)[source]

    
Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degree.

Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degree `deg` and sample points `x`.
The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

\\[V[..., i] = T_i(x),\\]

where `0 <= i <= deg`. The leading indices of `V` index the elements of `x`
and the last index is the degree of the Chebyshev polynomial.

If `c` is a 1-D array of coefficients of length `n + 1` and `V` is the matrix
`V = chebvander(x, n)`, then `np.dot(V, c)` and `chebval(x, c)` are the same
up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares fitting and
for the evaluation of a large number of Chebyshev series of the same degree
and sample points.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
Array of points. The dtype is converted to float64 or complex128 depending on
whether any of the elements are complex. If `x` is scalar it is converted to a
1-D array.

degint

    
Degree of the resulting matrix.

Returns

    
vanderndarray

    
The pseudo Vandermonde matrix. The shape of the returned matrix is `x.shape +
(deg + 1,)`, where The last index is the degree of the corresponding Chebyshev
polynomial. The dtype will be the same as the converted `x`.
