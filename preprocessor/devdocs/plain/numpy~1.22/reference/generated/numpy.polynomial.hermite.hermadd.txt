# numpy.polynomial.hermite.hermadd

polynomial.hermite.hermadd(c1, c2)[source]

    
Add one Hermite series to another.

Returns the sum of two Hermite series `c1` \+ `c2`. The arguments are
sequences of coefficients ordered from lowest order term to highest, i.e.,
[1,2,3] represents the series `P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2`.

Parameters

    
c1, c2array_like

    
1-D arrays of Hermite series coefficients ordered from low to high.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
Array representing the Hermite series of their sum.

#### Notes

Unlike multiplication, division, etc., the sum of two Hermite series is a
Hermite series (without having to “reproject” the result onto the basis set)
so addition, just like that of “standard” polynomials, is simply “component-
wise.”

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite import hermadd
    >>> hermadd([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4])
    array([2., 4., 6., 4.])
