# numpy.signbit

numpy.signbit(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K',
dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'signbit'>

    
Returns element-wise True where signbit is set (less than zero).

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
The input value(s).

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
resultndarray of bool

    
Output array, or reference to `out` if that was supplied. This is a scalar if
`x` is a scalar.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.signbit(-1.2)
    True
    >>> np.signbit(np.array([1, -2.3, 2.1]))
    array([False,  True, False])
