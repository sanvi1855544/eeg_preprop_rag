# numpy.testing.assert_array_almost_equal_nulp

testing.assert_array_almost_equal_nulp(x, y, nulp=1)[source]

    
Compare two arrays relatively to their spacing.

This is a relatively robust method to compare two arrays whose amplitude is
variable.

Parameters

    
x, yarray_like

    
Input arrays.

nulpint, optional

    
The maximum number of unit in the last place for tolerance (see Notes).
Default is 1.

Returns

    
None

Raises

    
AssertionError

    
If the spacing between `x` and `y` for one or more elements is larger than
`nulp`.

See also

`assert_array_max_ulp`

    
Check that all items of arrays differ in at most N Units in the Last Place.

`spacing`

    
Return the distance between x and the nearest adjacent number.

#### Notes

An assertion is raised if the following condition is not met:

    
    abs(x - y) <= nulps * spacing(maximum(abs(x), abs(y)))
    
#### Examples

    
    >>> x = np.array([1., 1e-10, 1e-20])
    >>> eps = np.finfo(x.dtype).eps
    >>> np.testing.assert_array_almost_equal_nulp(x, x*eps/2 + x)
    
    
    >>> np.testing.assert_array_almost_equal_nulp(x, x*eps + x)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    AssertionError: X and Y are not equal to 1 ULP (max is 2)
