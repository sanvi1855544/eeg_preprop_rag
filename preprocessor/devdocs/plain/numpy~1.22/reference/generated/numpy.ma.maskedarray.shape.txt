# numpy.ma.MaskedArray.shape

property

property ma.MaskedArray.shape

    
Tuple of array dimensions.

The shape property is usually used to get the current shape of an array, but
may also be used to reshape the array in-place by assigning a tuple of array
dimensions to it. As with `numpy.reshape`, one of the new shape dimensions can
be -1, in which case its value is inferred from the size of the array and the
remaining dimensions. Reshaping an array in-place will fail if a copy is
required.

#### Examples

    
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> x.shape
    (4,)
    >>> y = np.zeros((2, 3, 4))
    >>> y.shape
    (2, 3, 4)
    >>> y.shape = (3, 8)
    >>> y
    array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]])
    >>> y.shape = (3, 6)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ValueError: total size of new array must be unchanged
    >>> np.zeros((4,2))[::2].shape = (-1,)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: Incompatible shape for in-place modification. Use
    `.reshape()` to make a copy with the desired shape.
