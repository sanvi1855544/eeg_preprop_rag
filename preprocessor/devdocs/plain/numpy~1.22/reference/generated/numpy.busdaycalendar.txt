# numpy.busdaycalendar

class numpy.busdaycalendar(weekmask='1111100', holidays=None)[source]

    
A business day calendar object that efficiently stores information defining
valid days for the busday family of functions.

The default valid days are Monday through Friday (“business days”). A
busdaycalendar object can be specified with any set of weekly valid days, plus
an optional “holiday” dates that always will be invalid.

Once a busdaycalendar object is created, the weekmask and holidays cannot be
modified.

New in version 1.7.0.

Parameters

    
weekmaskstr or array_like of bool, optional

    
A seven-element array indicating which of Monday through Sunday are valid
days. May be specified as a length-seven list or array, like [1,1,1,1,1,0,0];
a length-seven string, like ‘1111100’; or a string like “Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri”,
made up of 3-character abbreviations for weekdays, optionally separated by
white space. Valid abbreviations are: Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun

holidaysarray_like of datetime64[D], optional

    
An array of dates to consider as invalid dates, no matter which weekday they
fall upon. Holiday dates may be specified in any order, and NaT (not-a-time)
dates are ignored. This list is saved in a normalized form that is suited for
fast calculations of valid days.

Returns

    
outbusdaycalendar

    
A business day calendar object containing the specified weekmask and holidays
values.

#### Examples

    
    >>> # Some important days in July
    ... bdd = np.busdaycalendar(
    ...             holidays=['2011-07-01', '2011-07-04', '2011-07-17'])
    >>> # Default is Monday to Friday weekdays
    ... bdd.weekmask
    array([ True,  True,  True,  True,  True, False, False])
    >>> # Any holidays already on the weekend are removed
    ... bdd.holidays
    array(['2011-07-01', '2011-07-04'], dtype='datetime64[D]')
    
Attributes

    
Note: once a busdaycalendar object is created, you cannot modify the

weekmask or holidays. The attributes return copies of internal data.

`weekmask`(copy) seven-element array of bool

    
A copy of the seven-element boolean mask indicating valid days.

`holidays`(copy) sorted array of datetime64[D]

    
A copy of the holiday array indicating additional invalid days.
