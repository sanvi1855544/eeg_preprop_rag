# Constants of the numpy.ma module

In addition to the `MaskedArray` class, the `numpy.ma` module defines several
constants.

numpy.ma.masked

    
The `masked` constant is a special case of `MaskedArray`, with a float
datatype and a null shape. It is used to test whether a specific entry of a
masked array is masked, or to mask one or several entries of a masked array:

    
    >>> x = ma.array([1, 2, 3], mask=[0, 1, 0])
    >>> x[1] is ma.masked
    True
    >>> x[-1] = ma.masked
    >>> x
    masked_array(data=[1, --, --],
                 mask=[False,  True,  True],
           fill_value=999999)
    
numpy.ma.nomask

    
Value indicating that a masked array has no invalid entry. `nomask` is used
internally to speed up computations when the mask is not needed. It is
represented internally as `np.False_`.

numpy.ma.masked_print_options

    
String used in lieu of missing data when a masked array is printed. By
default, this string is `'--'`.
