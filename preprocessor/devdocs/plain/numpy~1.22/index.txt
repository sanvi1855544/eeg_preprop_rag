NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a
Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived
objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines
for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape
manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic
linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
