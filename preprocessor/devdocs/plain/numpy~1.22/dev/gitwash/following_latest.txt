# Get the local copy of the code

From the command line:

    
    git clone git://github.com/numpy/numpy.git
    
You now have a copy of the code tree in the new `numpy` directory. If this
doesn’t work you can try the alternative read-only url:

    
    git clone https://github.com/numpy/numpy.git
