# F2PY user guide and reference manual

The purpose of the `F2PY` –Fortran to Python interface generator– utility is
to provide a connection between Python and Fortran languages. F2PY is a part
of NumPy (`numpy.f2py`) and also available as a standalone command line tool
`f2py` when `numpy` is installed that facilitates creating/building Python
C/API extension modules that make it possible

  * to call Fortran 77/90/95 external subroutines and Fortran 90/95 module subroutines as well as C functions;
  * to access Fortran 77 `COMMON` blocks and Fortran 90/95 module data, including allocatable arrays

from Python.

  * Using F2PY
    * Command `f2py`
    * Python module `numpy.f2py`
