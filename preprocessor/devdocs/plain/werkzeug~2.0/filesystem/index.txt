# Filesystem Utilities

Various utilities for the local filesystem.

`class werkzeug.filesystem.BrokenFilesystemWarning`

    
The warning used by Werkzeug to signal a broken filesystem. Will only be used
once per runtime.

`werkzeug.filesystem.get_filesystem_encoding()`

    
Returns the filesystem encoding that should be used. Note that this is
different from the Python understanding of the filesystem encoding which might
be deeply flawed. Do not use this value against Python’s string APIs because
it might be different. See The Filesystem for the exact behavior.

The concept of a filesystem encoding in generally is not something you should
rely on. As such if you ever need to use this function except for writing
wrapper code reconsider.

Return type

    
str
