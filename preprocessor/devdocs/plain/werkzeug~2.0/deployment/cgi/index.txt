# CGI

If all other deployment methods do not work, CGI will work for sure. CGI is
supported by all major servers but usually has a less-than-optimal
performance.

This is also the way you can use a Werkzeug application on Google’s AppEngine,
there however the execution does happen in a CGI-like environment. The
application’s performance is unaffected because of that.

## Creating a `.cgi` file

First you need to create the CGI application file. Let’s call it
`yourapplication.cgi`:

    
    #!/usr/bin/python
    from wsgiref.handlers import CGIHandler
    from yourapplication import make_app
    
    application = make_app()
    CGIHandler().run(application)
    
## Server Setup

Usually there are two ways to configure the server. Either just copy the
`.cgi` into a `cgi-bin` (and use `mod_rewrite` or something similar to rewrite
the URL) or let the server point to the file directly.

In Apache for example you can put something like this into the config:

    
    ScriptAlias /app /path/to/the/application.cgi
    
For more information consult the documentation of your webserver.
