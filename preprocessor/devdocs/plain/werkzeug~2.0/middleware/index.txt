# Middleware

A WSGI middleware is a WSGI application that wraps another application in
order to observe or change its behavior. Werkzeug provides some middleware for
common use cases.

  * X-Forwarded-For Proxy Fix
  * Serve Shared Static Files
  * Application Dispatcher
  * Basic HTTP Proxy
  * WSGI Protocol Linter
  * Application Profiler

The interactive debugger is also a middleware that can be applied manually,
although it is typically used automatically with the development server.
