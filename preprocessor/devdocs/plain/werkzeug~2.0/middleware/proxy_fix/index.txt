# X-Forwarded-For Proxy Fix

This module provides a middleware that adjusts the WSGI environ based on
`X-Forwarded-` headers that proxies in front of an application may set.

When an application is running behind a proxy server, WSGI may see the request
as coming from that server rather than the real client. Proxies set various
headers to track where the request actually came from.

This middleware should only be used if the application is actually behind such
a proxy, and should be configured with the number of proxies that are chained
in front of it. Not all proxies set all the headers. Since incoming headers
can be faked, you must set how many proxies are setting each header so the
middleware knows what to trust.

`class werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix.ProxyFix(app, x_for=1, x_proto=1,
x_host=0, x_port=0, x_prefix=0)`

    
Adjust the WSGI environ based on `X-Forwarded-` that proxies in front of the
application may set.

  * `X-Forwarded-For` sets `REMOTE_ADDR`.
  * `X-Forwarded-Proto` sets `wsgi.url_scheme`.
  * `X-Forwarded-Host` sets `HTTP_HOST`, `SERVER_NAME`, and `SERVER_PORT`.
  * `X-Forwarded-Port` sets `HTTP_HOST` and `SERVER_PORT`.
  * `X-Forwarded-Prefix` sets `SCRIPT_NAME`.

You must tell the middleware how many proxies set each header so it knows what
values to trust. It is a security issue to trust values that came from the
client rather than a proxy.

The original values of the headers are stored in the WSGI environ as
`werkzeug.proxy_fix.orig`, a dict.

Parameters

    
  * app (WSGIApplication) – The WSGI application to wrap.
  * x_for (int) – Number of values to trust for `X-Forwarded-For`.
  * x_proto (int) – Number of values to trust for `X-Forwarded-Proto`.
  * x_host (int) – Number of values to trust for `X-Forwarded-Host`.
  * x_port (int) – Number of values to trust for `X-Forwarded-Port`.
  * x_prefix (int) – Number of values to trust for `X-Forwarded-Prefix`.

Return type

    
None

    
    from werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix import ProxyFix
    # App is behind one proxy that sets the -For and -Host headers.
    app = ProxyFix(app, x_for=1, x_host=1)
    
Changelog

Changed in version 1.0: Deprecated code has been removed:

  * The `num_proxies` argument and attribute.
  * The `get_remote_addr` method.
  * The environ keys `orig_remote_addr`, `orig_wsgi_url_scheme`, and `orig_http_host`.

Changed in version 0.15: All headers support multiple values. The
`num_proxies` argument is deprecated. Each header is configured with a
separate number of trusted proxies.

Changed in version 0.15: Original WSGI environ values are stored in the
`werkzeug.proxy_fix.orig` dict. `orig_remote_addr`, `orig_wsgi_url_scheme`,
and `orig_http_host` are deprecated and will be removed in 1.0.

Changed in version 0.15: Support `X-Forwarded-Port` and `X-Forwarded-Prefix`.

Changed in version 0.15: `X-Forwarded-Host` and `X-Forwarded-Port` modify
`SERVER_NAME` and `SERVER_PORT`.
