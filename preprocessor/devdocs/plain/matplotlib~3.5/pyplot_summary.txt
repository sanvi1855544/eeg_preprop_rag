## Colors in Matplotlib

There are many colormaps you can use to map data onto color values. Below we
list several ways in which color can be utilized in Matplotlib.

For a more in-depth look at colormaps, see the Choosing Colormaps in
Matplotlib tutorial.

matplotlib.pyplot.colormaps[source]

    
Container for colormaps that are known to Matplotlib by name.

Experimental

While we expect the API to be final, we formally mark it as experimental for
3.5 because we want to keep the option to still adapt the API for 3.6 should
the need arise.

The universal registry instance is `matplotlib.colormaps`. There should be no
need for users to instantiate `ColormapRegistry` themselves.

Read access uses a dict-like interface mapping names to `Colormap`s:

    
    import matplotlib as mpl
    cmap = mpl.colormaps['viridis']
    
Returned `Colormap`s are copies, so that their modification does not change
the global definition of the colormap.

Additional colormaps can be added via `ColormapRegistry.register`:

    
    mpl.colormaps.register(my_colormap)
