# matplotlib.animation.TimedAnimation

classmatplotlib.animation.TimedAnimation(fig, interval=200, repeat_delay=0,
repeat=True, event_source=None, *args, **kwargs)[source]

    
`Animation` subclass for time-based animation.

A new frame is drawn every interval milliseconds.

Note

You must store the created Animation in a variable that lives as long as the
animation should run. Otherwise, the Animation object will be garbage-
collected and the animation stops.

Parameters

    
fig`Figure`

    
The figure object used to get needed events, such as draw or resize.

intervalint, default: 200

    
Delay between frames in milliseconds.

repeat_delayint, default: 0

    
The delay in milliseconds between consecutive animation runs, if repeat is
True.

repeatbool, default: True

    
Whether the animation repeats when the sequence of frames is completed.

blitbool, default: False

    
Whether blitting is used to optimize drawing.

__init__(fig, interval=200, repeat_delay=0, repeat=True, event_source=None,

#### Methods

`__init__`(fig[, interval, repeat_delay, ...]) |   
---|---  
`new_frame_seq`() | Return a new sequence of frame information.  
`new_saved_frame_seq`() | Return a new sequence of saved/cached frame information.  
`pause`() | Pause the animation.  
`resume`() | Resume the animation.  
`save`(filename[, writer, fps, dpi, codec, ...]) | Save the animation as a movie file by drawing every frame.  
`to_html5_video`([embed_limit]) | Convert the animation to an HTML5 `<video>` tag.  
`to_jshtml`([fps, embed_frames, default_mode]) | Generate HTML representation of the animation.
