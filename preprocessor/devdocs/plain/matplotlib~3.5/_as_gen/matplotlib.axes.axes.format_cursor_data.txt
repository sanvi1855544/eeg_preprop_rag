# matplotlib.axes.Axes.format_cursor_data

Axes.format_cursor_data(data)[source]

    
Return a string representation of data.

Note

This method is intended to be overridden by artist subclasses. As an end-user
of Matplotlib you will most likely not call this method yourself.

The default implementation converts ints and floats and arrays of ints and
floats into a comma-separated string enclosed in square brackets, unless the
artist has an associated colorbar, in which case scalar values are formatted
using the colorbar's formatter.
