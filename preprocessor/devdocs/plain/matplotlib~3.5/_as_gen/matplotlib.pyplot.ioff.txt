# matplotlib.pyplot.ioff

matplotlib.pyplot.ioff()[source]

    
Disable interactive mode.

See `pyplot.isinteractive` for more details.

See also

`ion`

    
Enable interactive mode.

`isinteractive`

    
Whether interactive mode is enabled.

`show`

    
Show all figures (and maybe block).

`pause`

    
Show all figures, and block for a time.

#### Notes

For a temporary change, this can be used as a context manager:

    
    # if interactive mode is on
    # then figures will be shown on creation
    plt.ion()
    # This figure will be shown immediately
    fig = plt.figure()
    
    with plt.ioff():
        # interactive mode will be off
        # figures will not automatically be shown
        fig2 = plt.figure()
        # ...
    
To enable usage as a context manager, this function returns an `_IoffContext`
object. The return value is not intended to be stored or accessed by the user.
