# matplotlib.colors.make_norm_from_scale

matplotlib.colors.make_norm_from_scale(scale_cls, base_norm_cls=None, *,
init=None)[source]

    
Decorator for building a `Normalize` subclass from a `ScaleBase` subclass.

After

    
    @make_norm_from_scale(scale_cls)
    class norm_cls(Normalize):
        ...
    
norm_cls is filled with methods so that normalization computations are
forwarded to scale_cls (i.e., scale_cls is the scale that would be used for
the colorbar of a mappable normalized with norm_cls).

If init is not passed, then the constructor signature of norm_cls will be
`norm_cls(vmin=None, vmax=None, clip=False)`; these three parameters will be
forwarded to the base class (`Normalize.__init__`), and a scale_cls object
will be initialized with no arguments (other than a dummy axis).

If the scale_cls constructor takes additional parameters, then init should be
passed to `make_norm_from_scale`. It is a callable which is only used for its
signature. First, this signature will become the signature of norm_cls.
Second, the norm_cls constructor will bind the parameters passed to it using
this signature, extract the bound vmin, vmax, and clip values, pass those to
`Normalize.__init__`, and forward the remaining bound values (including any
defaults defined by the signature) to the scale_cls constructor.
