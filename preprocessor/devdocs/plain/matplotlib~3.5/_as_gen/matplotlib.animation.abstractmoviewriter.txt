# matplotlib.animation.AbstractMovieWriter

classmatplotlib.animation.AbstractMovieWriter(fps=5, metadata=None,
codec=None, bitrate=None)[source]

    
Abstract base class for writing movies. Fundamentally, what a MovieWriter does
is provide is a way to grab frames by calling grab_frame().

setup() is called to start the process and finish() is called afterwards.

This class is set up to provide for writing movie frame data to a pipe.
saving() is provided as a context manager to facilitate this process as:

    
    with moviewriter.saving(fig, outfile='myfile.mp4', dpi=100):
        # Iterate over frames
        moviewriter.grab_frame(**savefig_kwargs)
    
The use of the context manager ensures that setup() and finish() are performed
as necessary.

An instance of a concrete subclass of this class can be given as the `writer`
argument of `Animation.save()`.

__init__(fps=5, metadata=None, codec=None, bitrate=None)[source]

#### Methods

`__init__`([fps, metadata, codec, bitrate]) |   
---|---  
`finish`() | Finish any processing for writing the movie.  
`grab_frame`(**savefig_kwargs) | Grab the image information from the figure and save as a movie frame.  
`saving`(fig, outfile, dpi, *args, **kwargs) | Context manager to facilitate writing the movie file.  
`setup`(fig, outfile[, dpi]) | Setup for writing the movie file.  
#### Attributes

`frame_size` | A tuple `(width, height)` in pixels of a movie frame.  
---|---  
abstractfinish()[source]

    
Finish any processing for writing the movie.

propertyframe_size

    
A tuple `(width, height)` in pixels of a movie frame.

abstractgrab_frame(**savefig_kwargs)[source]

    
Grab the image information from the figure and save as a movie frame.

All keyword arguments in savefig_kwargs are passed on to the `savefig` call
that saves the figure.

saving(fig, outfile, dpi, *args, **kwargs)

    
Context manager to facilitate writing the movie file.

`*args, **kw` are any parameters that should be passed to `setup`.

abstractsetup(fig, outfile, dpi=None)[source]

    
Setup for writing the movie file.

Parameters

    
fig`Figure`

    
The figure object that contains the information for frames.

outfilestr

    
The filename of the resulting movie file.

dpifloat, default: `fig.dpi`

    
The DPI (or resolution) for the file. This controls the size in pixels of the
resulting movie file.
