# mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.axes_size.from_any

mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.axes_size.from_any(size, fraction_ref=None)[source]

    
Create a Fixed unit when the first argument is a float, or a Fraction unit if
that is a string that ends with %. The second argument is only meaningful when
Fraction unit is created.

    
    >>> a = Size.from_any(1.2) # => Size.Fixed(1.2)
    >>> Size.from_any("50%", a) # => Size.Fraction(0.5, a)
