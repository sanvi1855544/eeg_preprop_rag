# matplotlib.artist.Artist.set_clip_path

Artist.set_clip_path(path, transform=None)[source]

    
Set the artist's clip path.

Parameters

    
path`Patch` or `Path` or `TransformedPath` or None

    
The clip path. If given a `Path`, transform must be provided as well. If None,
a previously set clip path is removed.

transform`Transform`, optional

    
Only used if path is a `Path`, in which case the given `Path` is converted to
a `TransformedPath` using transform.

#### Notes

For efficiency, if path is a `Rectangle` this method will set the clipping box
to the corresponding rectangle and set the clipping path to `None`.

For technical reasons (support of `set`), a tuple (path, transform) is also
accepted as a single positional parameter.
