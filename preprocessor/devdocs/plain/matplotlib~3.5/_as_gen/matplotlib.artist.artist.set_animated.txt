# matplotlib.artist.Artist.set_animated

Artist.set_animated(b)[source]

    
Set whether the artist is intended to be used in an animation.

If True, the artist is excluded from regular drawing of the figure. You have
to call `Figure.draw_artist` / `Axes.draw_artist` explicitly on the artist.
This appoach is used to speed up animations using blitting.

See also `matplotlib.animation` and Faster rendering by using blitting.
