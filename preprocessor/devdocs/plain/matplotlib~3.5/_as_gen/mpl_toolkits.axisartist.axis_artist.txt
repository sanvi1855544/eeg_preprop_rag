# mpl_toolkits.axisartist.axis_artist

The `axis_artist` module implements custom artists to draw axis elements (axis
lines and labels, tick lines and labels, grid lines).

Axis lines and labels and tick lines and labels are managed by the
`AxisArtist` class; grid lines are managed by the `GridlinesCollection` class.

There is one `AxisArtist` per Axis; it can be accessed through the `axis`
dictionary of the parent Axes (which should be a
`mpl_toolkits.axislines.Axes`), e.g. `ax.axis["bottom"]`.

Children of the AxisArtist are accessed as attributes: `.line` and `.label`
for the axis line and label, `.major_ticks`, `.major_ticklabels`,
`.minor_ticks`, `.minor_ticklabels` for the tick lines and labels (e.g.
`ax.axis["bottom"].line`).

Children properties (colors, fonts, line widths, etc.) can be set using
setters, e.g.

    
    # Make the major ticks of the bottom axis red.
    ax.axis["bottom"].major_ticks.set_color("red")
    
However, things like the locations of ticks, and their ticklabels need to be
changed from the side of the grid_helper.

## axis_direction

`AxisArtist`, `AxisLabel`, `TickLabels` have an axis_direction attribute,
which adjusts the location, angle, etc. The axis_direction must be one of
"left", "right", "bottom", "top", and follows the Matplotlib convention for
rectangular axis.

For example, for the bottom axis (the left and right is relative to the
direction of the increasing coordinate),

  * ticklabels and axislabel are on the right
  * ticklabels and axislabel have text angle of 0
  * ticklabels are baseline, center-aligned
  * axislabel is top, center-aligned

The text angles are actually relative to (90 + angle of the direction to the
ticklabel), which gives 0 for bottom axis.

Parameter | left | bottom | right | top  
---|---|---|---|---  
ticklabels location | left | right | right | left  
axislabel location | left | right | right | left  
ticklabels angle | 90 | 0 | -90 | 180  
axislabel angle | 180 | 0 | 0 | 180  
ticklabel va | center | baseline | center | baseline  
axislabel va | center | top | center | bottom  
ticklabel ha | right | center | right | center  
axislabel ha | right | center | right | center  
Ticks are by default direct opposite side of the ticklabels. To make ticks to
the same side of the ticklabels,

    
    ax.axis["bottom"].major_ticks.set_tick_out(True)
    
The following attributes can be customized (use the `set_xxx` methods):

  * `Ticks`: ticksize, tick_out
  * `TickLabels`: pad
  * `AxisLabel`: pad

## Classes

`AttributeCopier`() |   
---|---  
`AxisArtist`(axes, helper[, offset, ...]) | An artist which draws axis (a line along which the n-th axes coord is constant) line, ticks, ticklabels, and axis label.  
`AxisLabel`(*args[, axis_direction, axis]) | Axis Label.  
`GridlinesCollection`(*args[, which, axis]) | 
Parameters  
`LabelBase`(*args, **kwargs) | A base class for AxisLabel and TickLabels.  
`TickLabels`(*[, axis_direction]) | Tick Labels.  
`Ticks`(ticksize[, tick_out, axis]) | Ticks are derived from Line2D, and note that ticks themselves are markers.
