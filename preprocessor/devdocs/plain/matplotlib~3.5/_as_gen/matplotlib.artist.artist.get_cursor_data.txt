# matplotlib.artist.Artist.get_cursor_data

Artist.get_cursor_data(event)[source]

    
Return the cursor data for a given event.

Note

This method is intended to be overridden by artist subclasses. As an end-user
of Matplotlib you will most likely not call this method yourself.

Cursor data can be used by Artists to provide additional context information
for a given event. The default implementation just returns None.

Subclasses can override the method and return arbitrary data. However, when
doing so, they must ensure that `format_cursor_data` can convert the data to a
string representation.

The only current use case is displaying the z-value of an `AxesImage` in the
status bar of a plot window, while moving the mouse.

Parameters

    
event`matplotlib.backend_bases.MouseEvent`
