# matplotlib.pyplot.fill_betweenx

matplotlib.pyplot.fill_betweenx(y, x1, x2=0, where=None, step=None,
interpolate=False, *, data=None, **kwargs)[source]

    
Fill the area between two vertical curves.

The curves are defined by the points (y, x1) and (y, x2). This creates one or
multiple polygons describing the filled area.

You may exclude some vertical sections from filling using where.

By default, the edges connect the given points directly. Use step if the
filling should be a step function, i.e. constant in between y.

Parameters

    
yarray (length N)

    
The y coordinates of the nodes defining the curves.

x1array (length N) or scalar

    
The x coordinates of the nodes defining the first curve.

x2array (length N) or scalar, default: 0

    
The x coordinates of the nodes defining the second curve.

wherearray of bool (length N), optional

    
Define where to exclude some vertical regions from being filled. The filled
regions are defined by the coordinates `y[where]`. More precisely, fill
between `y[i]` and `y[i+1]` if `where[i] and where[i+1]`. Note that this
definition implies that an isolated True value between two False values in
where will not result in filling. Both sides of the True position remain
unfilled due to the adjacent False values.

interpolatebool, default: False

    
This option is only relevant if where is used and the two curves are crossing
each other.

Semantically, where is often used for x1 > x2 or similar. By default, the
nodes of the polygon defining the filled region will only be placed at the
positions in the y array. Such a polygon cannot describe the above semantics
close to the intersection. The y-sections containing the intersection are
simply clipped.

Setting interpolate to True will calculate the actual intersection point and
extend the filled region up to this point.

step{'pre', 'post', 'mid'}, optional

    
Define step if the filling should be a step function, i.e. constant in between
y. The value determines where the step will occur:

  * 'pre': The y value is continued constantly to the left from every x position, i.e. the interval `(x[i-1], x[i]]` has the value `y[i]`.
  * 'post': The y value is continued constantly to the right from every x position, i.e. the interval `[x[i], x[i+1])` has the value `y[i]`.
  * 'mid': Steps occur half-way between the x positions.

Returns

    
`PolyCollection`

    
A `PolyCollection` containing the plotted polygons.

Other Parameters

    
dataindexable object, optional

    
If given, the following parameters also accept a string `s`, which is
interpreted as `data[s]` (unless this raises an exception):

y, x1, x2, where
