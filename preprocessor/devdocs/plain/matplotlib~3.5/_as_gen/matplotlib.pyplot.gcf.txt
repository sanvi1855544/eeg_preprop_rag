# matplotlib.pyplot.gcf

matplotlib.pyplot.gcf()[source]

    
Get the current figure.

If there is currently no figure on the pyplot figure stack, a new one is
created using `figure()`. (To test whether there is currently a figure on the
pyplot figure stack, check whether `get_fignums()` is empty.)
