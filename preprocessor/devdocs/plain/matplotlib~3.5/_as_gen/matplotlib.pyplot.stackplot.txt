# matplotlib.pyplot.stackplot

matplotlib.pyplot.stackplot(x, *args, labels=(), colors=None, baseline='zero',
data=None, **kwargs)[source]

    
Draw a stacked area plot.

Parameters

    
x(N,) array-like

y(M, N) array-like

    
The data is assumed to be unstacked. Each of the following calls is legal:

    
    stackplot(x, y)           # where y has shape (M, N)
    stackplot(x, y1, y2, y3)  # where y1, y2, y3, y4 have length N
    
baseline{'zero', 'sym', 'wiggle', 'weighted_wiggle'}

    
Method used to calculate the baseline:

  * `'zero'`: Constant zero baseline, i.e. a simple stacked plot.
  * `'sym'`: Symmetric around zero and is sometimes called 'ThemeRiver'.
  * `'wiggle'`: Minimizes the sum of the squared slopes.
  * `'weighted_wiggle'`: Does the same but weights to account for size of each layer. It is also called 'Streamgraph'-layout. More details can be found at http://leebyron.com/streamgraph/.

labelslist of str, optional

    
A sequence of labels to assign to each data series. If unspecified, then no
labels will be applied to artists.

colorslist of color, optional

    
A sequence of colors to be cycled through and used to color the stacked areas.
The sequence need not be exactly the same length as the number of provided y,
in which case the colors will repeat from the beginning.

If not specified, the colors from the Axes property cycle will be used.

dataindexable object, optional

    
If given, all parameters also accept a string `s`, which is interpreted as
`data[s]` (unless this raises an exception).

**kwargs

    
All other keyword arguments are passed to `Axes.fill_between`.

Returns

    
list of `PolyCollection`

    
A list of `PolyCollection` instances, one for each element in the stacked area
plot.
