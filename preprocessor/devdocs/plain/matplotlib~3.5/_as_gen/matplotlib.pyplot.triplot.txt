# matplotlib.pyplot.triplot

matplotlib.pyplot.triplot(*args, **kwargs)[source]

    
Draw a unstructured triangular grid as lines and/or markers.

The triangulation to plot can be specified in one of two ways; either:

    
    triplot(triangulation, ...)
    
where triangulation is a `Triangulation` object, or

    
    triplot(x, y, ...)
    triplot(x, y, triangles, ...)
    triplot(x, y, triangles=triangles, ...)
    triplot(x, y, mask=mask, ...)
    triplot(x, y, triangles, mask=mask, ...)
    
in which case a Triangulation object will be created. See `Triangulation` for
a explanation of these possibilities.

The remaining args and kwargs are the same as for `plot`.

Returns

    
lines`Line2D`

    
The drawn triangles edges.

markers`Line2D`

    
The drawn marker nodes.
