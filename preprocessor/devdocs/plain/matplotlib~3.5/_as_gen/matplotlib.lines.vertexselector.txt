# matplotlib.lines.VertexSelector

classmatplotlib.lines.VertexSelector(line)[source]

    
Bases: `object`

Manage the callbacks to maintain a list of selected vertices for `Line2D`.
Derived classes should override the `process_selected` method to do something
with the picks.

Here is an example which highlights the selected verts with red circles:

    
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.lines as lines
    
    class HighlightSelected(lines.VertexSelector):
        def __init__(self, line, fmt='ro', **kwargs):
            lines.VertexSelector.__init__(self, line)
            self.markers, = self.axes.plot([], [], fmt, **kwargs)
    
        def process_selected(self, ind, xs, ys):
            self.markers.set_data(xs, ys)
            self.canvas.draw()
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    x, y = np.random.rand(2, 30)
    line, = ax.plot(x, y, 'bs-', picker=5)
    
    selector = HighlightSelected(line)
    plt.show()
    
Initialize the class with a `Line2D`. The line should already be added to an
`Axes` and should have the picker property set.

onpick(event)[source]

    
When the line is picked, update the set of selected indices.

process_selected(ind, xs, ys)[source]

    
Default "do nothing" implementation of the `process_selected` method.

Parameters

    
indlist of int

    
The indices of the selected vertices.

xs, ysarray-like

    
The coordinates of the selected vertices.
