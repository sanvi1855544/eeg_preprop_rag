# mpl_toolkits.axisartist.floating_axes.ExtremeFinderFixed

classmpl_toolkits.axisartist.floating_axes.ExtremeFinderFixed(extremes)[source]

    
Bases: `mpl_toolkits.axisartist.grid_finder.ExtremeFinderSimple`

This subclass always returns the same bounding box.

Parameters

    
extremes(float, float, float, float)

    
The bounding box that this helper always returns.

__call__(transform_xy, x1, y1, x2, y2)[source]

    
Compute an approximation of the bounding box obtained by applying transform_xy
to the box delimited by `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.

The intended use is to have `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` in axes coordinates, and have
transform_xy be the transform from axes coordinates to data coordinates; this
method then returns the range of data coordinates that span the actual axes.

The computation is done by sampling `nx * ny` equispaced points in the `(x1,
y1, x2, y2)` box and finding the resulting points with extremal coordinates;
then adding some padding to take into account the finite sampling.

As each sampling step covers a relative range of 1/nx or 1/ny, the padding is
computed by expanding the span covered by the extremal coordinates by these
fractions.
