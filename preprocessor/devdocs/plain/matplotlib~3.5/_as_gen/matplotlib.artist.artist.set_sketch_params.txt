# matplotlib.artist.Artist.set_sketch_params

Artist.set_sketch_params(scale=None, length=None, randomness=None)[source]

    
Set the sketch parameters.

Parameters

    
scalefloat, optional

    
The amplitude of the wiggle perpendicular to the source line, in pixels. If
scale is `None`, or not provided, no sketch filter will be provided.

lengthfloat, optional

    
The length of the wiggle along the line, in pixels (default 128.0)

randomnessfloat, optional

    
The scale factor by which the length is shrunken or expanded (default 16.0)

The PGF backend uses this argument as an RNG seed and not as described above.
Using the same seed yields the same random shape.
