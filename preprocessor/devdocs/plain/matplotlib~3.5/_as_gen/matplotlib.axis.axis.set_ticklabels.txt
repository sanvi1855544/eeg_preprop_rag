# matplotlib.axis.Axis.set_ticklabels

Axis.set_ticklabels(ticklabels, *, minor=False, **kwargs)[source]

    
Set the text values of the tick labels.

Discouraged

The use of this method is discouraged, because of the dependency on tick
positions. In most cases, you'll want to use `set_[x/y]ticks(positions,
labels)` instead.

If you are using this method, you should always fix the tick positions before,
e.g. by using `Axis.set_ticks` or by explicitly setting a `FixedLocator`.
Otherwise, ticks are free to move and the labels may end up in unexpected
positions.

Parameters

    
ticklabelssequence of str or of `Text`s

    
Texts for labeling each tick location in the sequence set by `Axis.set_ticks`;
the number of labels must match the number of locations.

minorbool

    
If True, set minor ticks instead of major ticks.

**kwargs

    
Text properties.

Returns

    
list of `Text`s

    
For each tick, includes `tick.label1` if it is visible, then `tick.label2` if
it is visible, in that order.
