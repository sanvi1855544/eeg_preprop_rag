# matplotlib.axis.Axis.set_data_interval

Axis.set_data_interval(vmin, vmax, ignore=False)[source]

    
Set the axis data limits. This method is for internal use.

If ignore is False (the default), this method will never reduce the
preexisting data limits, only expand them if vmin or vmax are not within them.
Moreover, the order of vmin and vmax does not matter; the orientation of the
axis will not change.

If ignore is True, the data limits will be set exactly to `(vmin, vmax)` in
that order.
