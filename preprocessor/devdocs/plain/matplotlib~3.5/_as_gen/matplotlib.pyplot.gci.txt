# matplotlib.pyplot.gci

matplotlib.pyplot.gci()[source]

    
Get the current colorable artist.

Specifically, returns the current `ScalarMappable` instance (`Image` created
by `imshow` or `figimage`, `Collection` created by `pcolor` or `scatter`,
etc.), or None if no such instance has been defined.

The current image is an attribute of the current Axes, or the nearest earlier
Axes in the current figure that contains an image.

#### Notes

Historically, the only colorable artists were images; hence the name `gci`
(get current image).
