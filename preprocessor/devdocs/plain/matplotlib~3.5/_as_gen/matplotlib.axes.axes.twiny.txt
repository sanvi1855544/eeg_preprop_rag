# matplotlib.axes.Axes.twiny

Axes.twiny()[source]

    
Create a twin Axes sharing the yaxis.

Create a new Axes with an invisible y-axis and an independent x-axis
positioned opposite to the original one (i.e. at top). The y-axis autoscale
setting will be inherited from the original Axes. To ensure that the tick
marks of both x-axes align, see `LinearLocator`.

Returns

    
Axes

    
The newly created Axes instance

#### Notes

For those who are 'picking' artists while using twiny, pick events are only
called for the artists in the top-most Axes.
