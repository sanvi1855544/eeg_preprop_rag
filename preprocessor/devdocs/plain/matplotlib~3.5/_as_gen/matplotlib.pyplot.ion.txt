# matplotlib.pyplot.ion

matplotlib.pyplot.ion()[source]

    
Enable interactive mode.

See `pyplot.isinteractive` for more details.

See also

`ioff`

    
Disable interactive mode.

`isinteractive`

    
Whether interactive mode is enabled.

`show`

    
Show all figures (and maybe block).

`pause`

    
Show all figures, and block for a time.

#### Notes

For a temporary change, this can be used as a context manager:

    
    # if interactive mode is off
    # then figures will not be shown on creation
    plt.ioff()
    # This figure will not be shown immediately
    fig = plt.figure()
    
    with plt.ion():
        # interactive mode will be on
        # figures will automatically be shown
        fig2 = plt.figure()
        # ...
    
To enable usage as a context manager, this function returns an `_IonContext`
object. The return value is not intended to be stored or accessed by the user.
