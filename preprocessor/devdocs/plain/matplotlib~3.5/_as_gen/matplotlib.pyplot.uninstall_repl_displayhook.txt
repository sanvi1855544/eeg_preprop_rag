# matplotlib.pyplot.uninstall_repl_displayhook

matplotlib.pyplot.uninstall_repl_displayhook()[source]

    
Uninstall the Matplotlib display hook.

Warning

Need IPython >= 2 for this to work. For IPython < 2 will raise a
`NotImplementedError`

Warning

If you are using vanilla python and have installed another display hook, this
will reset `sys.displayhook` to what ever function was there when Matplotlib
installed its displayhook, possibly discarding your changes.
