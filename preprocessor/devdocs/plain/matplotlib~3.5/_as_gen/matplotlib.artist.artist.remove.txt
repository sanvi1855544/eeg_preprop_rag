# matplotlib.artist.Artist.remove

Artist.remove()[source]

    
Remove the artist from the figure if possible.

The effect will not be visible until the figure is redrawn, e.g., with
`FigureCanvasBase.draw_idle`. Call `relim` to update the axes limits if
desired.

Note: `relim` will not see collections even if the collection was added to the
axes with autolim = True.

Note: there is no support for removing the artist's legend entry.
