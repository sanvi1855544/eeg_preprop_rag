# matplotlib.artist.Artist.get_window_extent

Artist.get_window_extent(renderer)[source]

    
Get the artist's bounding box in display space.

The bounding box' width and height are nonnegative.

Subclasses should override for inclusion in the bounding box "tight"
calculation. Default is to return an empty bounding box at 0, 0.

Be careful when using this function, the results will not update if the artist
window extent of the artist changes. The extent can change due to any changes
in the transform stack, such as changing the axes limits, the figure size, or
the canvas used (as is done when saving a figure). This can lead to unexpected
behavior where interactive figures will look fine on the screen, but will save
incorrectly.
