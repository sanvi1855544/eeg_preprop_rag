# matplotlib.pyplot.tripcolor

matplotlib.pyplot.tripcolor(*args, alpha=1.0, norm=None, cmap=None, vmin=None,
vmax=None, shading='flat', facecolors=None, **kwargs)[source]

    
Create a pseudocolor plot of an unstructured triangular grid.

The triangulation can be specified in one of two ways; either:

    
    tripcolor(triangulation, ...)
    
where triangulation is a `Triangulation` object, or

    
    tripcolor(x, y, ...)
    tripcolor(x, y, triangles, ...)
    tripcolor(x, y, triangles=triangles, ...)
    tripcolor(x, y, mask=mask, ...)
    tripcolor(x, y, triangles, mask=mask, ...)
    
in which case a Triangulation object will be created. See `Triangulation` for
a explanation of these possibilities.

The next argument must be C, the array of color values, either one per point
in the triangulation if color values are defined at points, or one per
triangle in the triangulation if color values are defined at triangles. If
there are the same number of points and triangles in the triangulation it is
assumed that color values are defined at points; to force the use of color
values at triangles use the kwarg `facecolors=C` instead of just `C`.

shading may be 'flat' (the default) or 'gouraud'. If shading is 'flat' and C
values are defined at points, the color values used for each triangle are from
the mean C of the triangle's three points. If shading is 'gouraud' then color
values must be defined at points.

The remaining kwargs are the same as for `pcolor`.
