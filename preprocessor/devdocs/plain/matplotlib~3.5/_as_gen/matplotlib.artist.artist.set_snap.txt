# matplotlib.artist.Artist.set_snap

Artist.set_snap(snap)[source]

    
Set the snapping behavior.

Snapping aligns positions with the pixel grid, which results in clearer
images. For example, if a black line of 1px width was defined at a position in
between two pixels, the resulting image would contain the interpolated value
of that line in the pixel grid, which would be a grey value on both adjacent
pixel positions. In contrast, snapping will move the line to the nearest
integer pixel value, so that the resulting image will really contain a 1px
wide black line.

Snapping is currently only supported by the Agg and MacOSX backends.

Parameters

    
snapbool or None

    
Possible values:

  * True: Snap vertices to the nearest pixel center.
  * False: Do not modify vertex positions.
  * None: (auto) If the path contains only rectilinear line segments, round to the nearest pixel center.
