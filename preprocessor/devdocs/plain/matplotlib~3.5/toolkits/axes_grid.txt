# mpl_toolkits.axes_grid

Note

AxesGrid has been a part of matplotlib since v 0.99. Originally, the toolkit
used the axes_grid namespace. In more recent versions, the toolkit has been
split into axes_grid1 and axisartist. While axes_grid is maintained for the
backward compatibility, use of axes_grid1 and axisartist is recommended. For
the documentation on `axes_grid`, see the previous version of the docs.
