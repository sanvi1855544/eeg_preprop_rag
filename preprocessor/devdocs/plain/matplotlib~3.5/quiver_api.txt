# matplotlib.quiver

Support for plotting vector fields.

Presently this contains Quiver and Barb. Quiver plots an arrow in the
direction of the vector, with the size of the arrow related to the magnitude
of the vector.

Barbs are like quiver in that they point along a vector, but the magnitude of
the vector is given schematically by the presence of barbs or flags on the
barb.

This will also become a home for things such as standard deviation ellipses,
which can and will be derived very easily from the Quiver code.

## Classes

---|---  
`QuiverKey`(Q, X, Y, U, label, *[, angle, ...]) | Labelled arrow for use as a quiver plot scale key.  
`Barbs`(ax, *args[, pivot, length, barbcolor, ...]) | Specialized PolyCollection for barbs.
