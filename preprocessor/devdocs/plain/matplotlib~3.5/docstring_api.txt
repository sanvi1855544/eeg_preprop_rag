# matplotlib.docstring

classmatplotlib.docstring.Substitution(*args, **kwargs)[source]

    
Bases: `object`

A decorator that performs %-substitution on an object's docstring.

This decorator should be robust even if `obj.__doc__` is None (for example, if
-OO was passed to the interpreter).

Usage: construct a docstring.Substitution with a sequence or dictionary
suitable for performing substitution; then decorate a suitable function with
the constructed object, e.g.:

    
    sub_author_name = Substitution(author='Jason')
    
    @sub_author_name
    def some_function(x):
        "%(author)s wrote this function"
    
    # note that some_function.__doc__ is now "Jason wrote this function"
    
One can also use positional arguments:

    
    sub_first_last_names = Substitution('Edgar Allen', 'Poe')
    
    @sub_first_last_names
    def some_function(x):
        "%s %s wrote the Raven"
    
update(*args, **kwargs)[source]

    
Update `self.params` (which must be a dict) with the supplied args.

matplotlib.docstring.copy(source)[source]

    
Copy a docstring from another source function (if present).
