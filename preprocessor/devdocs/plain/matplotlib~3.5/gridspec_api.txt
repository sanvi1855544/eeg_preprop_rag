# matplotlib.gridspec

`gridspec` contains classes that help to layout multiple `Axes` in a grid-like
pattern within a figure.

The `GridSpec` specifies the overall grid structure. Individual cells within
the grid are referenced by `SubplotSpec`s.

Often, users need not access this module directly, and can use higher-level
methods like `subplots`, `subplot_mosaic` and `subfigures`. See the tutorial
Arranging multiple Axes in a Figure for a guide.

## Classes

`GridSpec`(nrows, ncols[, figure, left, ...]) | A grid layout to place subplots within a figure.  
---|---  
`SubplotSpec`(gridspec, num1[, num2]) | The location of a subplot in a `GridSpec`.  
`GridSpecBase`(nrows, ncols[, height_ratios, ...]) | A base class of GridSpec that specifies the geometry of the grid that a subplot will be placed.  
`GridSpecFromSubplotSpec`(nrows, ncols, ...[, ...]) | GridSpec whose subplot layout parameters are inherited from the location specified by a given SubplotSpec.
