# torch.narrow

`torch.narrow(input, dim, start, length) → Tensor`

    
Returns a new tensor that is a narrowed version of `input` tensor. The
dimension `dim` is input from `start` to `start + length`. The returned tensor
and `input` tensor share the same underlying storage.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the tensor to narrow
  * dim (int) – the dimension along which to narrow
  * start (int) – the starting dimension
  * length (int) – the distance to the ending dimension

Example:

    
    >>> x = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    >>> torch.narrow(x, 0, 0, 2)
    tensor([[ 1,  2,  3],
            [ 4,  5,  6]])
    >>> torch.narrow(x, 1, 1, 2)
    tensor([[ 2,  3],
            [ 5,  6],
            [ 8,  9]])
