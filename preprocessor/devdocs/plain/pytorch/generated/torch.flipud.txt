# torch.flipud

`torch.flipud(input) → Tensor`

    
Flip tensor in the up/down direction, returning a new tensor.

Flip the entries in each column in the up/down direction. Rows are preserved,
but appear in a different order than before.

Note

Requires the tensor to be at least 1-D.

Note

`torch.flipud` makes a copy of `input`’s data. This is different from NumPy’s
`np.flipud`, which returns a view in constant time. Since copying a tensor’s
data is more work than viewing that data, `torch.flipud` is expected to be
slower than `np.flipud`.

Parameters

    
input (Tensor) – Must be at least 1-dimensional.

Example:

    
    >>> x = torch.arange(4).view(2, 2)
    >>> x
    tensor([[0, 1],
            [2, 3]])
    >>> torch.flipud(x)
    tensor([[2, 3],
            [0, 1]])
