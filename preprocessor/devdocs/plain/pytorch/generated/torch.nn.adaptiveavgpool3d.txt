# AdaptiveAvgPool3d

`class torch.nn.AdaptiveAvgPool3d(output_size)` [source]

    
Applies a 3D adaptive average pooling over an input signal composed of several
input planes.

The output is of size D x H x W, for any input size. The number of output
features is equal to the number of input planes.

Parameters

    
output_size – the target output size of the form D x H x W. Can be a tuple (D,
H, W) or a single number D for a cube D x D x D. D, H and W can be either a
`int`, or `None` which means the size will be the same as that of the input.

#### Examples

    
    >>> # target output size of 5x7x9
    >>> m = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool3d((5,7,9))
    >>> input = torch.randn(1, 64, 8, 9, 10)
    >>> output = m(input)
    >>> # target output size of 7x7x7 (cube)
    >>> m = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool3d(7)
    >>> input = torch.randn(1, 64, 10, 9, 8)
    >>> output = m(input)
    >>> # target output size of 7x9x8
    >>> m = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool3d((7, None, None))
    >>> input = torch.randn(1, 64, 10, 9, 8)
    >>> output = m(input)
