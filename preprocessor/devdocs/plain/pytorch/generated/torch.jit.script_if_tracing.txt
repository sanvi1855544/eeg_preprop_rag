# torch.jit.script_if_tracing

`torch.jit.script_if_tracing(fn)` [source]

    
Compiles `fn` when it is first called during tracing. `torch.jit.script` has a
non-negligible start up time when it is first called due to lazy-
initializations of many compiler builtins. Therefore you should not use it in
library code. However, you may want to have parts of your library work in
tracing even if they use control flow. In these cases, you should use
`@torch.jit.script_if_tracing` to substitute for `torch.jit.script`.

Parameters

    
fn – A function to compile.

Returns

    
If called during tracing, a `ScriptFunction` created by `torch.jit.script` is
returned. Otherwise, the original function `fn` is returned.
