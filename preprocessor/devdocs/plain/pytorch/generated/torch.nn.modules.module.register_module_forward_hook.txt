# torch.nn.modules.module.register_module_forward_hook

`torch.nn.modules.module.register_module_forward_hook(hook)` [source]

    
Registers a global forward hook for all the modules

Warning

This adds global state to the `nn.module` module and it is only intended for
debugging/profiling purposes.

The hook will be called every time after `forward()` has computed an output.
It should have the following signature:

    
    hook(module, input, output) -> None or modified output
    
The input contains only the positional arguments given to the module. Keyword
arguments won’t be passed to the hooks and only to the `forward`. The hook can
modify the output. It can modify the input inplace but it will not have effect
on forward since this is called after `forward()` is called.

Returns

    
a handle that can be used to remove the added hook by calling
`handle.remove()`

Return type

    
`torch.utils.hooks.RemovableHandle`

This hook will be executed before specific module hooks registered with
`register_forward_hook`.
