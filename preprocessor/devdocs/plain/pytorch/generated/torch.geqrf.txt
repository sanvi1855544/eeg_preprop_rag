# torch.geqrf

`torch.geqrf(input, *, out=None) -> (Tensor, Tensor)`

    
This is a low-level function for calling LAPACK directly. This function
returns a namedtuple (a, tau) as defined in LAPACK documentation for geqrf .

You’ll generally want to use `torch.qr()` instead.

Computes a QR decomposition of `input`, but without constructing QQ and RR as
explicit separate matrices.

Rather, this directly calls the underlying LAPACK function `?geqrf` which
produces a sequence of ‘elementary reflectors’.

See LAPACK documentation for geqrf for further details.

Parameters

    
input (Tensor) – the input matrix

Keyword Arguments

    
out (tuple, optional) – the output tuple of (Tensor, Tensor)
