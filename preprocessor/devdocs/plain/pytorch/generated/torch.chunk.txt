# torch.chunk

`torch.chunk(input, chunks, dim=0) → List of Tensors`

    
Splits a tensor into a specific number of chunks. Each chunk is a view of the
input tensor.

Last chunk will be smaller if the tensor size along the given dimension `dim`
is not divisible by `chunks`.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the tensor to split
  * chunks (int) – number of chunks to return
  * dim (int) – dimension along which to split the tensor
