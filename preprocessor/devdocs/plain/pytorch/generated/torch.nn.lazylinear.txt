# LazyLinear

`class torch.nn.LazyLinear(out_features, bias=True)` [source]

    
A `torch.nn.Linear` module with lazy initialization.

In this module, the `weight` and `bias` are of
`torch.nn.UninitializedParameter` class. They will be initialized after the
first call to `forward` is done and the module will become a regular
`torch.nn.Linear` module.

Check the `torch.nn.modules.lazy.LazyModuleMixin` for further documentation on
lazy modules and their limitations.

Parameters

    
  * out_features – size of each output sample
  * bias – If set to `False`, the layer will not learn an additive bias. Default: `True`

Variables

    
  * ~LazyLinear.weight – the learnable weights of the module of shape (out_features,in_features)(\text{out\\_features}, \text{in\\_features}) . The values are initialized from U(−k,k)\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k}) , where k=1in_featuresk = \frac{1}{\text{in\\_features}}
  * ~LazyLinear.bias – the learnable bias of the module of shape (out_features)(\text{out\\_features}) . If `bias` is `True`, the values are initialized from U(−k,k)\mathcal{U}(-\sqrt{k}, \sqrt{k}) where k=1in_featuresk = \frac{1}{\text{in\\_features}}
