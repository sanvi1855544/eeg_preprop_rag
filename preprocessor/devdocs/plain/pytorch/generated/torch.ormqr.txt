# torch.ormqr

`torch.ormqr(input, input2, input3, left=True, transpose=False) → Tensor`

    
Multiplies `mat` (given by `input3`) by the orthogonal `Q` matrix of the QR
factorization formed by `torch.geqrf()` that is represented by `(a, tau)`
(given by (`input`, `input2`)).

This directly calls the underlying LAPACK function `?ormqr`. See LAPACK
documentation for ormqr for further details.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the `a` from `torch.geqrf()`.
  * input2 (Tensor) – the `tau` from `torch.geqrf()`.
  * input3 (Tensor) – the matrix to be multiplied.
