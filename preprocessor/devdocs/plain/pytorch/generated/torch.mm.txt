# torch.mm

`torch.mm(input, mat2, *, out=None) → Tensor`

    
Performs a matrix multiplication of the matrices `input` and `mat2`.

If `input` is a (n×m)(n \times m) tensor, `mat2` is a (m×p)(m \times p)
tensor, `out` will be a (n×p)(n \times p) tensor.

Note

This function does not broadcast. For broadcasting matrix products, see
`torch.matmul()`.

Supports strided and sparse 2-D tensors as inputs, autograd with respect to
strided inputs.

This operator supports TensorFloat32.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the first matrix to be matrix multiplied
  * mat2 (Tensor) – the second matrix to be matrix multiplied

Keyword Arguments

    
out (Tensor, optional) – the output tensor.

Example:

    
    >>> mat1 = torch.randn(2, 3)
    >>> mat2 = torch.randn(3, 3)
    >>> torch.mm(mat1, mat2)
    tensor([[ 0.4851,  0.5037, -0.3633],
            [-0.0760, -3.6705,  2.4784]])
