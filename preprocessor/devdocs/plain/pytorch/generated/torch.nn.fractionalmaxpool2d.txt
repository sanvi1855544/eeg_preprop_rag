# FractionalMaxPool2d

`class torch.nn.FractionalMaxPool2d(kernel_size, output_size=None,
output_ratio=None, return_indices=False, _random_samples=None)` [source]

    
Applies a 2D fractional max pooling over an input signal composed of several
input planes.

Fractional MaxPooling is described in detail in the paper Fractional
MaxPooling by Ben Graham

The max-pooling operation is applied in kH×kWkH \times kW regions by a
stochastic step size determined by the target output size. The number of
output features is equal to the number of input planes.

Parameters

    
  * kernel_size – the size of the window to take a max over. Can be a single number k (for a square kernel of k x k) or a tuple `(kh, kw)`
  * output_size – the target output size of the image of the form `oH x oW`. Can be a tuple `(oH, oW)` or a single number oH for a square image `oH x oH`
  * output_ratio – If one wants to have an output size as a ratio of the input size, this option can be given. This has to be a number or tuple in the range (0, 1)
  * return_indices – if `True`, will return the indices along with the outputs. Useful to pass to `nn.MaxUnpool2d()`. Default: `False`

#### Examples

    
    >>> # pool of square window of size=3, and target output size 13x12
    >>> m = nn.FractionalMaxPool2d(3, output_size=(13, 12))
    >>> # pool of square window and target output size being half of input image size
    >>> m = nn.FractionalMaxPool2d(3, output_ratio=(0.5, 0.5))
    >>> input = torch.randn(20, 16, 50, 32)
    >>> output = m(input)
