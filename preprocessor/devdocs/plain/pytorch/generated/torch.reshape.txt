# torch.reshape

`torch.reshape(input, shape) → Tensor`

    
Returns a tensor with the same data and number of elements as `input`, but
with the specified shape. When possible, the returned tensor will be a view of
`input`. Otherwise, it will be a copy. Contiguous inputs and inputs with
compatible strides can be reshaped without copying, but you should not depend
on the copying vs. viewing behavior.

See `torch.Tensor.view()` on when it is possible to return a view.

A single dimension may be -1, in which case it’s inferred from the remaining
dimensions and the number of elements in `input`.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the tensor to be reshaped
  * shape (tuple of python:ints) – the new shape

Example:

    
    >>> a = torch.arange(4.)
    >>> torch.reshape(a, (2, 2))
    tensor([[ 0.,  1.],
            [ 2.,  3.]])
    >>> b = torch.tensor([[0, 1], [2, 3]])
    >>> torch.reshape(b, (-1,))
    tensor([ 0,  1,  2,  3])
