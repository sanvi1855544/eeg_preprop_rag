# Parameter

`class torch.nn.parameter.Parameter` [source]

    
A kind of Tensor that is to be considered a module parameter.

Parameters are `Tensor` subclasses, that have a very special property when
used with `Module` s - when they’re assigned as Module attributes they are
automatically added to the list of its parameters, and will appear e.g. in
`parameters()` iterator. Assigning a Tensor doesn’t have such effect. This is
because one might want to cache some temporary state, like last hidden state
of the RNN, in the model. If there was no such class as `Parameter`, these
temporaries would get registered too.

Parameters

    
  * data (Tensor) – parameter tensor.
  * requires_grad (bool, optional) – if the parameter requires gradient. See Excluding subgraphs from backward for more details. Default: `True`
