# torch.fliplr

`torch.fliplr(input) → Tensor`

    
Flip tensor in the left/right direction, returning a new tensor.

Flip the entries in each row in the left/right direction. Columns are
preserved, but appear in a different order than before.

Note

Requires the tensor to be at least 2-D.

Note

`torch.fliplr` makes a copy of `input`’s data. This is different from NumPy’s
`np.fliplr`, which returns a view in constant time. Since copying a tensor’s
data is more work than viewing that data, `torch.fliplr` is expected to be
slower than `np.fliplr`.

Parameters

    
input (Tensor) – Must be at least 2-dimensional.

Example:

    
    >>> x = torch.arange(4).view(2, 2)
    >>> x
    tensor([[0, 1],
            [2, 3]])
    >>> torch.fliplr(x)
    tensor([[1, 0],
            [3, 2]])
