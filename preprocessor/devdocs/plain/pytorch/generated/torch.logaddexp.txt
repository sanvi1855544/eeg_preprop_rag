# torch.logaddexp

`torch.logaddexp(input, other, *, out=None) → Tensor`

    
Logarithm of the sum of exponentiations of the inputs.

Calculates pointwise log⁡(ex+ey)\log\left(e^x + e^y\right) . This function is
useful in statistics where the calculated probabilities of events may be so
small as to exceed the range of normal floating point numbers. In such cases
the logarithm of the calculated probability is stored. This function allows
adding probabilities stored in such a fashion.

This op should be disambiguated with `torch.logsumexp()` which performs a
reduction on a single tensor.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the input tensor.
  * other (Tensor) – the second input tensor

Keyword Arguments

    
out (Tensor, optional) – the output tensor.

Example:

    
    >>> torch.logaddexp(torch.tensor([-1.0]), torch.tensor([-1.0, -2, -3]))
    tensor([-0.3069, -0.6867, -0.8731])
    >>> torch.logaddexp(torch.tensor([-100.0, -200, -300]), torch.tensor([-1.0, -2, -3]))
    tensor([-1., -2., -3.])
    >>> torch.logaddexp(torch.tensor([1.0, 2000, 30000]), torch.tensor([-1.0, -2, -3]))
    tensor([1.1269e+00, 2.0000e+03, 3.0000e+04])
