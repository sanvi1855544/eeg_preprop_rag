# torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_

`torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(parameters, max_norm, norm_type=2.0)` [source]

    
Clips gradient norm of an iterable of parameters.

The norm is computed over all gradients together, as if they were concatenated
into a single vector. Gradients are modified in-place.

Parameters

    
  * parameters (Iterable[Tensor] or Tensor) – an iterable of Tensors or a single Tensor that will have gradients normalized
  * max_norm (float or int) – max norm of the gradients
  * norm_type (float or int) – type of the used p-norm. Can be `'inf'` for infinity norm.

Returns

    
Total norm of the parameters (viewed as a single vector).
