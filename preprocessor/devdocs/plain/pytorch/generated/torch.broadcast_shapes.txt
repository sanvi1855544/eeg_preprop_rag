# torch.broadcast_shapes

`torch.broadcast_shapes(*shapes) → Size` [source]

    
Similar to `broadcast_tensors()` but for shapes.

This is equivalent to `torch.broadcast_tensors(*map(torch.empty,
shapes))[0].shape` but avoids the need create to intermediate tensors. This is
useful for broadcasting tensors of common batch shape but different rightmost
shape, e.g. to broadcast mean vectors with covariance matrices.

Example:

    
    >>> torch.broadcast_shapes((2,), (3, 1), (1, 1, 1))
    torch.Size([1, 3, 2])
    
Parameters

    
*shapes (torch.Size) – Shapes of tensors.
Returns

    
A shape compatible with all input shapes.

Return type

    
shape (torch.Size)

Raises

    
RuntimeError – If shapes are incompatible.
