# L1Loss

`class torch.nn.L1Loss(size_average=None, reduce=None, reduction='mean')`
[source]

    
Creates a criterion that measures the mean absolute error (MAE) between each
element in the input xx and target yy .

The unreduced (i.e. with `reduction` set to `'none'`) loss can be described
as:

ℓ(x,y)=L={l1,…,lN}⊤,ln=∣xn−yn∣,\ell(x, y) = L = \\{l_1,\dots,l_N\\}^\top,
\quad l_n = \left| x_n - y_n \right|,

where NN is the batch size. If `reduction` is not `'none'` (default `'mean'`),
then:

ℓ(x,y)={mean⁡(L),if reduction=‘mean’;sum⁡(L),if reduction=‘sum’.\ell(x, y) =
\begin{cases} \operatorname{mean}(L), & \text{if reduction} =
\text{`mean';}\\\ \operatorname{sum}(L), & \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
\end{cases}

xx and yy are tensors of arbitrary shapes with a total of nn elements each.

The sum operation still operates over all the elements, and divides by nn .

The division by nn can be avoided if one sets `reduction = 'sum'`.

Supports real-valued and complex-valued inputs.

Parameters

    
  * size_average (bool, optional) – Deprecated (see `reduction`). By default, the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field `size_average` is set to `False`, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored when `reduce` is `False`. Default: `True`
  * reduce (bool, optional) – Deprecated (see `reduction`). By default, the losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending on `size_average`. When `reduce` is `False`, returns a loss per batch element instead and ignores `size_average`. Default: `True`
  * reduction (string, optional) – Specifies the reduction to apply to the output: `'none'` | `'mean'` | `'sum'`. `'none'`: no reduction will be applied, `'mean'`: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of elements in the output, `'sum'`: the output will be summed. Note: `size_average` and `reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime, specifying either of those two args will override `reduction`. Default: `'mean'`

Shape:

    
  * Input: (N,∗)(N, *) where ∗* means, any number of additional dimensions
  * Target: (N,∗)(N, *) , same shape as the input
  * Output: scalar. If `reduction` is `'none'`, then (N,∗)(N, *) , same shape as the input

Examples:

    
    >>> loss = nn.L1Loss()
    >>> input = torch.randn(3, 5, requires_grad=True)
    >>> target = torch.randn(3, 5)
    >>> output = loss(input, target)
    >>> output.backward()
