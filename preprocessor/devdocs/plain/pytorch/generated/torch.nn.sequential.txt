# Sequential

`class torch.nn.Sequential(*args)` [source]

    
A sequential container. Modules will be added to it in the order they are
passed in the constructor. Alternatively, an ordered dict of modules can also
be passed in.

To make it easier to understand, here is a small example:

    
    # Example of using Sequential
    model = nn.Sequential(
              nn.Conv2d(1,20,5),
              nn.ReLU(),
              nn.Conv2d(20,64,5),
              nn.ReLU()
            )
    
    # Example of using Sequential with OrderedDict
    model = nn.Sequential(OrderedDict([
              ('conv1', nn.Conv2d(1,20,5)),
              ('relu1', nn.ReLU()),
              ('conv2', nn.Conv2d(20,64,5)),
              ('relu2', nn.ReLU())
            ]))
