# SobolEngine

`class torch.quasirandom.SobolEngine(dimension, scramble=False, seed=None)`
[source]

    
The `torch.quasirandom.SobolEngine` is an engine for generating (scrambled)
Sobol sequences. Sobol sequences are an example of low discrepancy quasi-
random sequences.

This implementation of an engine for Sobol sequences is capable of sampling
sequences up to a maximum dimension of 21201. It uses direction numbers from
https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~fkuo/sobol/ obtained using the search criterion
D(6) up to the dimension 21201. This is the recommended choice by the authors.

Parameters

    
  * dimension (Int) – The dimensionality of the sequence to be drawn
  * scramble (bool, optional) – Setting this to `True` will produce scrambled Sobol sequences. Scrambling is capable of producing better Sobol sequences. Default: `False`.
  * seed (Int, optional) – This is the seed for the scrambling. The seed of the random number generator is set to this, if specified. Otherwise, it uses a random seed. Default: `None`

Examples:

    
    >>> soboleng = torch.quasirandom.SobolEngine(dimension=5)
    >>> soboleng.draw(3)
    tensor([[0.5000, 0.5000, 0.5000, 0.5000, 0.5000],
            [0.7500, 0.2500, 0.7500, 0.2500, 0.7500],
            [0.2500, 0.7500, 0.2500, 0.7500, 0.2500]])
    
`draw(n=1, out=None, dtype=torch.float32)` [source]

    
Function to draw a sequence of `n` points from a Sobol sequence. Note that the
samples are dependent on the previous samples. The size of the result is
(n,dimension)(n, dimension) .

Parameters

    
  * n (Int, optional) – The length of sequence of points to draw. Default: 1
  * out (Tensor, optional) – The output tensor
  * dtype (`torch.dtype`, optional) – the desired data type of the returned tensor. Default: `torch.float32`

`draw_base2(m, out=None, dtype=torch.float32)` [source]

    
Function to draw a sequence of `2**m` points from a Sobol sequence. Note that
the samples are dependent on the previous samples. The size of the result is
(2∗∗m,dimension)(2**m, dimension) .

Parameters

    
  * m (Int) – The (base2) exponent of the number of points to draw.
  * out (Tensor, optional) – The output tensor
  * dtype (`torch.dtype`, optional) – the desired data type of the returned tensor. Default: `torch.float32`

`fast_forward(n)` [source]

    
Function to fast-forward the state of the `SobolEngine` by `n` steps. This is
equivalent to drawing `n` samples without using the samples.

Parameters

    
n (Int) – The number of steps to fast-forward by.

`reset()` [source]

    
Function to reset the `SobolEngine` to base state.
