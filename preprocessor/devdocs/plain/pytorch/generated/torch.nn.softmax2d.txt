# Softmax2d

`class torch.nn.Softmax2d` [source]

    
Applies SoftMax over features to each spatial location.

When given an image of `Channels x Height x Width`, it will apply `Softmax` to
each location (Channels,hi,wj)(Channels, h_i, w_j)

Shape:

    
  * Input: (N,C,H,W)(N, C, H, W)
  * Output: (N,C,H,W)(N, C, H, W) (same shape as input)

Returns

    
a Tensor of the same dimension and shape as the input with values in the range
[0, 1]

Examples:

    
    >>> m = nn.Softmax2d()
    >>> # you softmax over the 2nd dimension
    >>> input = torch.randn(2, 3, 12, 13)
    >>> output = m(input)
