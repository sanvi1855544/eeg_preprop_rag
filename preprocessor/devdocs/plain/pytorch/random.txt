# torch.random

`torch.random.fork_rng(devices=None, enabled=True, _caller='fork_rng',
_devices_kw='devices')` [source]

    
Forks the RNG, so that when you return, the RNG is reset to the state that it
was previously in.

Parameters

    
  * devices (iterable of CUDA IDs) – CUDA devices for which to fork the RNG. CPU RNG state is always forked. By default, `fork_rng()` operates on all devices, but will emit a warning if your machine has a lot of devices, since this function will run very slowly in that case. If you explicitly specify devices, this warning will be suppressed
  * enabled (bool) – if `False`, the RNG is not forked. This is a convenience argument for easily disabling the context manager without having to delete it and unindent your Python code under it.

`torch.random.get_rng_state()` [source]

    
Returns the random number generator state as a `torch.ByteTensor`.

`torch.random.initial_seed()` [source]

    
Returns the initial seed for generating random numbers as a Python `long`.

`torch.random.manual_seed(seed)` [source]

    
Sets the seed for generating random numbers. Returns a `torch.Generator`
object.

Parameters

    
seed (int) – The desired seed. Value must be within the inclusive range
`[-0x8000_0000_0000_0000, 0xffff_ffff_ffff_ffff]`. Otherwise, a RuntimeError
is raised. Negative inputs are remapped to positive values with the formula
`0xffff_ffff_ffff_ffff + seed`.

`torch.random.seed()` [source]

    
Sets the seed for generating random numbers to a non-deterministic random
number. Returns a 64 bit number used to seed the RNG.

`torch.random.set_rng_state(new_state)` [source]

    
Sets the random number generator state.

Parameters

    
new_state (torch.ByteTensor) – The desired state
