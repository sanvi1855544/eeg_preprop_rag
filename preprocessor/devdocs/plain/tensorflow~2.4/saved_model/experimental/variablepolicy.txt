`tf.compat.v1.saved_model.experimental.VariablePolicy`

NONE No policy applied: Distributed variables are saved as one variable, with
no device attached.

SAVE_VARIABLE_DEVICES When saving variables, also save their device
assignment. This is useful if one wants to hardcode devices in saved models,
but it also makes them non-portable if soft device placement is disabled (more
details in `tf.config.set_soft_device_placement`). This is currently not fully
supported by `saved_model.load`, and is mainly intended to be used when one
will be reading the saved model at a lower API level. In the example below,
the graph saved by the call to `saved_model.save` will have the variable
devices correctly specified:

    
    exported = tf.train.Checkpoint()
    with tf.device('/GPU:0'):
      exported.x_gpu = tf.Variable(1.0)
    with tf.device('/CPU:0'):
      exported.x_cpu = tf.Variable(1.0)
    tf.saved_model.save(exported, export_dir,
        options = tf.saved_model.SaveOptions(
            experimental_variable_policy=
              tf.saved_model.experimental.VariablePolicy.SAVE_VARIABLE_DEVICES))
    
Distributed variables are still saved as one variable under this policy.

EXPAND_DISTRIBUTED_VARIABLES Distributed variables will be saved with
information about their components, allowing for their restoration on load.
Also, the saved graph will contain references to those variables. This is
useful when one wants to use the model for training in environments where the
original distribution strategy is not available.
