    tf.sparse.reshape(
        sp_input, shape, name=None
    )
    
This operation has the same semantics as `reshape` on the represented dense
tensor. The indices of non-empty values in `sp_input` are recomputed based on
the new dense shape, and a new `SparseTensor` is returned containing the new
indices and new shape. The order of non-empty values in `sp_input` is
unchanged. If one component of `shape` is the special value -1, the size of
that dimension is computed so that the total dense size remains constant. At
most one component of `shape` can be -1. The number of dense elements implied
by `shape` must be the same as the number of dense elements originally
represented by `sp_input`. For example, if `sp_input` has shape `[2, 3, 6]`
and `indices` / `values`:

    
    [0, 0, 0]: a
    [0, 0, 1]: b
    [0, 1, 0]: c
    [1, 0, 0]: d
    [1, 2, 3]: e
    
and `shape` is `[9, -1]`, then the output will be a `SparseTensor` of shape
`[9, 4]` and `indices` / `values`:

    
    [0, 0]: a
    [0, 1]: b
    [1, 2]: c
    [4, 2]: d
    [8, 1]: e
    
| Args  
---  
`sp_input` |  The input `SparseTensor`.   
`shape` |  A 1-D (vector) int64 `Tensor` specifying the new dense shape of the represented `SparseTensor`.   
`name` |  A name prefix for the returned tensors (optional)   
Returns  
---  
A `SparseTensor` with the same non-empty values but with indices calculated by
the new dense shape.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `sp_input` is not a `SparseTensor`.   
`ValueError` |  If argument `shape` requests a `SparseTensor` with a different number of elements than `sp_input`.   
`ValueError` |  If `shape` has more than one inferred (== -1) dimension.
