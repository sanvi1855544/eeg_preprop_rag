    tf.sparse.mask(
        a, mask_indices, name=None
    )
    
Given an `IndexedSlices` instance `a`, returns another `IndexedSlices` that
contains a subset of the slices of `a`. Only the slices at indices not
specified in `mask_indices` are returned. This is useful when you need to
extract a subset of slices in an `IndexedSlices` object.

#### For example:

    
    # `a` contains slices at indices [12, 26, 37, 45] from a large tensor
    # with shape [1000, 10]
    a.indices  # [12, 26, 37, 45]
    tf.shape(a.values)  # [4, 10]
    
    # `b` will be the subset of `a` slices at its second and third indices, so
    # we want to mask its first and last indices (which are at absolute
    # indices 12, 45)
    b = tf.sparse.mask(a, [12, 45])
    
    b.indices  # [26, 37]
    tf.shape(b.values)  # [2, 10]
