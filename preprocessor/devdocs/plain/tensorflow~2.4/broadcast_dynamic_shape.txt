    tf.broadcast_dynamic_shape(
        shape_x, shape_y
    )
    
When `shape_x` and `shape_y` are Tensors representing shapes (i.e. the result
of calling tf.shape on another Tensor) this computes a Tensor which is the
shape of the result of a broadcasting op applied in tensors of shapes
`shape_x` and `shape_y`. This is useful when validating the result of a
broadcasting operation when the tensors do not have statically known shapes.

#### Example:

    
    shape_x = (1, 2, 3)
    shape_y = (5, 1, 3)
    tf.broadcast_dynamic_shape(shape_x, shape_y)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(3,), dtype=int32, numpy=array([5, 2, 3], ...>
    
| Args  
---  
`shape_x` |  A rank 1 integer `Tensor`, representing the shape of x.   
`shape_y` |  A rank 1 integer `Tensor`, representing the shape of y.   
Returns  
---  
A rank 1 integer `Tensor` representing the broadcasted shape.  
Raises  
---  
`InvalidArgumentError` |  If the two shapes are incompatible for broadcasting.
