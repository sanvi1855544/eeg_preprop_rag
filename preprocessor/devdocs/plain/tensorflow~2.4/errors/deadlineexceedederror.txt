        node_def, op, message
    )
    
This exception is not currently used. | Attributes  
---  
`error_code` |  The integer error code that describes the error.   
`message` |  The error message that describes the error.   
`node_def` |  The `NodeDef` proto representing the op that failed.   
`op` |  The operation that failed, if known. 
> Note: If the failed op was synthesized at runtime, e.g. a `Send` or `Recv`
> op, there will be no corresponding `tf.Operation` object. In that case, this
> will return `None`, and you should instead use the
> `tf.errors.OpError.node_def` to discover information about the op.
