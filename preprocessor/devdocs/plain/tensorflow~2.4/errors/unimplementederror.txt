    tf.errors.UnimplementedError(
        node_def, op, message
    )
    
Some operations may raise this error when passed otherwise-valid arguments that it does not currently support. For example, running the `tf.nn.max_pool2d` operation would raise this error if pooling was requested on the batch dimension, because this is not yet supported. | Attributes  
---  
`error_code` |  The integer error code that describes the error.   
`message` |  The error message that describes the error.   
`node_def` |  The `NodeDef` proto representing the op that failed.   
`op` |  The operation that failed, if known. 
> Note: If the failed op was synthesized at runtime, e.g. a `Send` or `Recv`
> op, there will be no corresponding `tf.Operation` object. In that case, this
> will return `None`, and you should instead use the
> `tf.errors.OpError.node_def` to discover information about the op.
