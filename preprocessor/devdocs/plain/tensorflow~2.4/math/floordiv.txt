    tf.math.floordiv(
        x, y, name=None
    )
    
The same as `tf.compat.v1.div(x,y)` for integers, but uses `tf.floor(tf.compat.v1.div(x,y))` for floating point arguments so that the result is always an integer (though possibly an integer represented as floating point). This op is generated by `x // y` floor division in Python 3 and in Python 2.7 with `from __future__ import division`. `x` and `y` must have the same type, and the result will have the same type as well. | Args  
---  
`x` |  `Tensor` numerator of real numeric type.   
`y` |  `Tensor` denominator of real numeric type.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
`x / y` rounded down.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If the inputs are complex.
