Main aliases `tf.reduce_min`

    
    tf.math.reduce_min(
        input_tensor, axis=None, keepdims=False, name=None
    )
    
Reduces `input_tensor` along the dimensions given in `axis`. Unless `keepdims` is true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each of the entries in `axis`, which must be unique. If `keepdims` is true, the reduced dimensions are retained with length 1. If `axis` is None, all dimensions are reduced, and a tensor with a single element is returned. | Args  
---  
`input_tensor` |  The tensor to reduce. Should have real numeric type.   
`axis` |  The dimensions to reduce. If `None` (the default), reduces all dimensions. Must be in the range `[-rank(input_tensor), rank(input_tensor))`.   
`keepdims` |  If true, retains reduced dimensions with length 1.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The reduced tensor.  
#### For example:

    
    a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    tf.reduce_min(a)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int32, numpy=1>
