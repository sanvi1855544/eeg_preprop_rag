    tf.math.betainc(
        a, b, x, name=None
    )
    
The regularized incomplete beta integral is defined as:

\\(I_x(a, b) = \frac{B(x; a, b)}{B(a, b)}\\)

where

\\(B(x; a, b) = \int_0^x t^{a-1} (1 - t)^{b-1} dt\\)

is the incomplete beta function and \\(B(a, b)\\) is the complete beta
function.
