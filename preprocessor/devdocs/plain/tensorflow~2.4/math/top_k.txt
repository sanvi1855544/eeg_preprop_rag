    tf.math.top_k(
        input, k=1, sorted=True, name=None
    )
    
If the input is a vector (rank=1), finds the `k` largest entries in the vector
and outputs their values and indices as vectors. Thus `values[j]` is the
`j`-th largest entry in `input`, and its index is `indices[j]`. For matrices
(resp. higher rank input), computes the top `k` entries in each row (resp.
vector along the last dimension). Thus,

    
    values.shape = indices.shape = input.shape[:-1] + [k]
    
If two elements are equal, the lower-index element appears first. | Args  
---  
`input` |  1-D or higher `Tensor` with last dimension at least `k`.   
`k` |  0-D `int32` `Tensor`. Number of top elements to look for along the last dimension (along each row for matrices).   
`sorted` |  If true the resulting `k` elements will be sorted by the values in descending order.   
`name` |  Optional name for the operation.   
Returns  
---  
`values` |  The `k` largest elements along each last dimensional slice.   
`indices` |  The indices of `values` within the last dimension of `input`.
