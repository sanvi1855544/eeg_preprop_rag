    tf.math.l2_normalize(
        x, axis=None, epsilon=1e-12, name=None
    )
    
For a 1-D tensor with `axis = 0`, computes

    
    output = x / sqrt(max(sum(x**2), epsilon))
    
For `x` with more dimensions, independently normalizes each 1-D slice along dimension `axis`. | Args  
---  
`x` |  A `Tensor`.   
`axis` |  Dimension along which to normalize. A scalar or a vector of integers.   
`epsilon` |  A lower bound value for the norm. Will use `sqrt(epsilon)` as the divisor if `norm < sqrt(epsilon)`.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` with the same shape as `x`.
