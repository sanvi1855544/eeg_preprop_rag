View source on GitHub  Computes the "logical and" of elements across
dimensions of a tensor.

Main aliases `tf.reduce_all`

    
    tf.math.reduce_all(
        input_tensor, axis=None, keepdims=False, name=None
    )
    
Reduces `input_tensor` along the dimensions given in `axis`. Unless `keepdims`
is true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each of the entries in
`axis`, which must be unique. If `keepdims` is true, the reduced dimensions
are retained with length 1. If `axis` is None, all dimensions are reduced, and
a tensor with a single element is returned.

#### For example:

    
    x = tf.constant([[True,  True], [False, False]])
    tf.reduce_all(x)  # False
    tf.reduce_all(x, 0)  # [False, False]
    tf.reduce_all(x, 1)  # [True, False]
    
| Args  
---  
`input_tensor` |  The boolean tensor to reduce.   
`axis` |  The dimensions to reduce. If `None` (the default), reduces all dimensions. Must be in the range `[-rank(input_tensor), rank(input_tensor))`.   
`keepdims` |  If true, retains reduced dimensions with length 1.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The reduced tensor.
