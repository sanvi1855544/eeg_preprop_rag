    tf.math.add_n(
        inputs, name=None
    )
    
`tf.math.add_n` performs the same operation as `tf.math.accumulate_n`, but it
waits for all of its inputs to be ready before beginning to sum. This
buffering can result in higher memory consumption when inputs are ready at
different times, since the minimum temporary storage required is proportional
to the input size rather than the output size. This op does not broadcast its
inputs. If you need broadcasting, use `tf.math.add` (or the `+` operator)
instead.

#### For example:

    
    a = tf.constant([[3, 5], [4, 8]])
    b = tf.constant([[1, 6], [2, 9]])
    tf.math.add_n([a, b, a])
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 2), dtype=int32, numpy=
    array([[ 7, 16],
           [10, 25]], dtype=int32)>
    
| Args  
---  
`inputs` |  A list of `tf.Tensor` or `tf.IndexedSlices` objects, each with the same shape and type. `tf.IndexedSlices` objects will be converted into dense tensors prior to adding.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `tf.Tensor` of the same shape and type as the elements of `inputs`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `inputs` don't all have same shape and dtype or the shape cannot be inferred.
