    tf.math.unsorted_segment_mean(
        data, segment_ids, num_segments, name=None
    )
    
Read the section on segmentation for an explanation of segments. This operator is similar to the `tf.math.unsorted_segment_sum` operator. Instead of computing the sum over segments, it computes the mean of all entries belonging to a segment such that: \\(output_i = 1/N_i \sum_{j...} data[j...]\\) where the sum is over tuples `j...` such that `segment_ids[j...] == i` with \N_i\ being the number of occurrences of id \i\\. If there is no entry for a given segment ID `i`, it outputs 0. If the given segment ID `i` is negative, the value is dropped and will not be added to the sum of the segment. | Args  
---  
`data` |  A `Tensor` with floating point or complex dtype.   
`segment_ids` |  An integer tensor whose shape is a prefix of `data.shape`.   
`num_segments` |  An integer scalar `Tensor`. The number of distinct segment IDs.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has same shape as data, except for the first `segment_ids.rank`
dimensions, which are replaced with a single dimension which has size
`num_segments`.
