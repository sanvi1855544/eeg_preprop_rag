    tf.math.reduce_logsumexp(
        input_tensor, axis=None, keepdims=False, name=None
    )
    
Reduces `input_tensor` along the dimensions given in `axis`. Unless `keepdims`
is true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each of the entries in
`axis`, which must be unique. If `keepdims` is true, the reduced dimensions
are retained with length 1. If `axis` has no entries, all dimensions are
reduced, and a tensor with a single element is returned. This function is more
numerically stable than log(sum(exp(input))). It avoids overflows caused by
taking the exp of large inputs and underflows caused by taking the log of
small inputs.

#### For example:

    
    x = tf.constant([[0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0.]])
    tf.reduce_logsumexp(x)  # log(6)
    tf.reduce_logsumexp(x, 0)  # [log(2), log(2), log(2)]
    tf.reduce_logsumexp(x, 1)  # [log(3), log(3)]
    tf.reduce_logsumexp(x, 1, keepdims=True)  # [[log(3)], [log(3)]]
    tf.reduce_logsumexp(x, [0, 1])  # log(6)
    
| Args  
---  
`input_tensor` |  The tensor to reduce. Should have numeric type.   
`axis` |  The dimensions to reduce. If `None` (the default), reduces all dimensions. Must be in the range `[-rank(input_tensor), rank(input_tensor))`.   
`keepdims` |  If true, retains reduced dimensions with length 1.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The reduced tensor.
