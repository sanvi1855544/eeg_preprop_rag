# tf.math.count_nonzero

View source on GitHub  Computes number of nonzero elements across dimensions
of a tensor.

    
    tf.math.count_nonzero(
        input, axis=None, keepdims=None, dtype=tf.dtypes.int64, name=None
    )
    
Reduces `input` along the dimensions given in `axis`. Unless `keepdims` is
true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each entry in `axis`. If
`keepdims` is true, the reduced dimensions are retained with length 1. If
`axis` has no entries, all dimensions are reduced, and a tensor with a single
element is returned.

> Note: Floating point comparison to zero is done by exact floating point
> equality check. Small values are not rounded to zero for purposes of the
> nonzero check.
#### For example:

    
    x = tf.constant([[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]])
    tf.math.count_nonzero(x)  # 3
    tf.math.count_nonzero(x, 0)  # [1, 2, 0]
    tf.math.count_nonzero(x, 1)  # [1, 2]
    tf.math.count_nonzero(x, 1, keepdims=True)  # [[1], [2]]
    tf.math.count_nonzero(x, [0, 1])  # 3
    
> Note: Strings are compared against zero-length empty string `""`. Any string
> with a size greater than zero is already considered as nonzero.
#### For example:

    
    x = tf.constant(["", "a", "  ", "b", ""])
    tf.math.count_nonzero(x) # 3, with "a", "  ", and "b" as nonzero strings.
    
| Args  
---  
`input` |  The tensor to reduce. Should be of numeric type, `bool`, or `string`.   
`axis` |  The dimensions to reduce. If `None` (the default), reduces all dimensions. Must be in the range `[-rank(input), rank(input))`.   
`keepdims` |  If true, retains reduced dimensions with length 1.   
`dtype` |  The output dtype; defaults to `tf.int64`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The reduced tensor (number of nonzero values).
