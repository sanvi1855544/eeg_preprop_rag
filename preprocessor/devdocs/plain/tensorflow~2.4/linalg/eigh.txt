    tf.linalg.eigh(
        tensor, name=None
    )
    
Computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the innermost N-by-N matrices in `tensor` such that `tensor[...,:,:] * v[..., :,i] = e[..., i] * v[...,:,i]`, for i=0...N-1. | Args  
---  
`tensor` |  `Tensor` of shape `[..., N, N]`. Only the lower triangular part of each inner inner matrix is referenced.   
`name` |  string, optional name of the operation.   
Returns  
---  
`e` |  Eigenvalues. Shape is `[..., N]`. Sorted in non-decreasing order.   
`v` |  Eigenvectors. Shape is `[..., N, N]`. The columns of the inner most matrices contain eigenvectors of the corresponding matrices in `tensor`
