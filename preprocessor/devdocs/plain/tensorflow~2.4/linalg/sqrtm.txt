    tf.linalg.sqrtm(
        input, name=None
    )
    
matmul(sqrtm(A), sqrtm(A)) = A

The input matrix should be invertible. If the input matrix is real, it should
have no eigenvalues which are real and negative (pairs of complex conjugate
eigenvalues are allowed).

The matrix square root is computed by first reducing the matrix to quasi-
triangular form with the real Schur decomposition. The square root of the
quasi-triangular matrix is then computed directly. Details of the algorithm
can be found in: Nicholas J. Higham, "Computing real square roots of a real
matrix", Linear Algebra Appl., 1987.

The input is a tensor of shape `[..., M, M]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions
form square matrices. The output is a tensor of the same shape as the input
containing the matrix square root for all input submatrices `[..., :, :]`.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float64`, `float32`, `half`, `complex64`, `complex128`. Shape is `[..., M, M]`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
