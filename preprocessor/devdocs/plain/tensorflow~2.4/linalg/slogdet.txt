`tf.compat.v1.linalg.slogdet`

    
    tf.linalg.slogdet(
        input, name=None
    )
    
one or more square matrices.

The input is a tensor of shape `[N, M, M]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions form
square matrices. The outputs are two tensors containing the signs and absolute
values of the log determinants for all N input submatrices `[..., :, :]` such
that `determinant = sign*exp(log_abs_determinant)`. The `log_abs_determinant`
is computed as `det(P)*sum(log(diag(LU)))` where `LU` is the `LU`
decomposition of the input and `P` is the corresponding permutation matrix.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`, `float64`, `complex64`, `complex128`. Shape is `[N, M, M]`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (sign, log_abs_determinant).  
`sign` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.   
`log_abs_determinant` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
