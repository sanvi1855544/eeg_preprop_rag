    tf.linalg.expm(
        input, name=None
    )
    
$$exp(A) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty A^n/n!$$  The exponential is computed using a combination of the scaling and squaring method and the Pade approximation. Details can be found in: Nicholas J. Higham, "The scaling and squaring method for the matrix exponential revisited," SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Applic., 26:1179-1193, 2005. The input is a tensor of shape `[..., M, M]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions form square matrices. The output is a tensor of the same shape as the input containing the exponential for all input submatrices `[..., :, :]`. | Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be `float16`, `float32`, `float64`, `complex64`, or `complex128` with shape `[..., M, M]`.   
`name` |  A name to give this `Op` (optional).   
Returns  
---  
the matrix exponential of the input.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  An unsupported type is provided as input.
