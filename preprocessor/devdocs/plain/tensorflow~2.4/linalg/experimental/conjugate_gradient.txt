`tf.compat.v1.linalg.experimental.conjugate_gradient`

    
    tf.linalg.experimental.conjugate_gradient(
        operator, rhs, preconditioner=None, x=None, tol=1e-05, max_iter=20,
        name='conjugate_gradient'
    )
    
Solves a linear system of equations `A*x = rhs` for self-adjoint, positive
definite matrix `A` and right-hand side vector `rhs`, using an iterative,
matrix-free algorithm where the action of the matrix A is represented by
`operator`. The iteration terminates when either the number of iterations
exceeds `max_iter` or when the residual norm has been reduced to `tol` times
its initial value, i.e. \\(||rhs - A x_k|| <= tol ||rhs||\\).

Args  
---  
`operator` |  A `LinearOperator` that is self-adjoint and positive definite.   
`rhs` |  A possibly batched vector of shape `[..., N]` containing the right-hand size vector.   
`preconditioner` |  A `LinearOperator` that approximates the inverse of `A`. An efficient preconditioner could dramatically improve the rate of convergence. If `preconditioner` represents matrix `M`(`M` approximates `A^{-1}`), the algorithm uses `preconditioner.apply(x)` to estimate `A^{-1}x`. For this to be useful, the cost of applying `M` should be much lower than computing `A^{-1}` directly.   
`x` |  A possibly batched vector of shape `[..., N]` containing the initial guess for the solution.   
`tol` |  A float scalar convergence tolerance.   
`max_iter` |  An integer giving the maximum number of iterations.   
`name` |  A name scope for the operation.   
Returns  
---  
`output` |  A namedtuple representing the final state with fields: 
  * i: A scalar `int32` `Tensor`. Number of iterations executed.
  * x: A rank-1 `Tensor` of shape `[..., N]` containing the computed solution.
  * r: A rank-1 `Tensor` of shape `[.., M]` containing the residual vector.
  * p: A rank-1 `Tensor` of shape `[..., N]`. `A`-conjugate basis vector.
  * gamma: \\(r \dot M \dot r\\), equivalent to \\(||r||_2^2\\) when `preconditioner=None`.
