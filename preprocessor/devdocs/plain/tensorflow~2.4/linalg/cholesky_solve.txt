    tf.linalg.cholesky_solve(
        chol, rhs, name=None
    )
    
Specifically, returns `X` from `A X = RHS`, where `A = L L^T`, `L` is the
`chol` arg and `RHS` is the `rhs` arg.

    
    # Solve 10 separate 2x2 linear systems:
    A = ... # shape 10 x 2 x 2
    RHS = ... # shape 10 x 2 x 1
    chol = tf.linalg.cholesky(A)  # shape 10 x 2 x 2
    X = tf.linalg.cholesky_solve(chol, RHS)  # shape 10 x 2 x 1
    # tf.matmul(A, X) ~ RHS
    X[3, :, 0]  # Solution to the linear system A[3, :, :] x = RHS[3, :, 0]
    
    # Solve five linear systems (K = 5) for every member of the length 10 batch.
    A = ... # shape 10 x 2 x 2
    RHS = ... # shape 10 x 2 x 5
    ...
    X[3, :, 2]  # Solution to the linear system A[3, :, :] x = RHS[3, :, 2]
    
| Args  
---  
`chol` |  A `Tensor`. Must be `float32` or `float64`, shape is `[..., M, M]`. Cholesky factorization of `A`, e.g. `chol = tf.linalg.cholesky(A)`. For that reason, only the lower triangular parts (including the diagonal) of the last two dimensions of `chol` are used. The strictly upper part is assumed to be zero and not accessed.   
`rhs` |  A `Tensor`, same type as `chol`, shape is `[..., M, K]`.   
`name` |  A name to give this `Op`. Defaults to `cholesky_solve`.   
Returns  
---  
Solution to `A x = rhs`, shape `[..., M, K]`.
