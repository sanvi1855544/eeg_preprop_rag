    tf.linalg.inv(
        input, adjoint=False, name=None
    )
    
The input is a tensor of shape `[..., M, M]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions
form square matrices. The output is a tensor of the same shape as the input
containing the inverse for all input submatrices `[..., :, :]`.

The op uses LU decomposition with partial pivoting to compute the inverses.

If a matrix is not invertible there is no guarantee what the op does. It may
detect the condition and raise an exception or it may simply return a garbage
result.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float64`, `float32`, `half`, `complex64`, `complex128`. Shape is `[..., M, M]`.   
`adjoint` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
