# tf.hessians

View source on GitHub  Constructs the Hessian of sum of `ys` with respect to
`x` in `xs`.

    
    tf.hessians(
        ys, xs, gate_gradients=False, aggregation_method=None, name='hessians'
    )
    
`hessians()` adds ops to the graph to output the Hessian matrix of `ys` with respect to `xs`. It returns a list of `Tensor` of length `len(xs)` where each tensor is the Hessian of `sum(ys)`. The Hessian is a matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar tensor (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix for more details). | Args  
---  
`ys` |  A `Tensor` or list of tensors to be differentiated.   
`xs` |  A `Tensor` or list of tensors to be used for differentiation.   
`gate_gradients` |  See `gradients()` documentation for details.   
`aggregation_method` |  See `gradients()` documentation for details.   
`name` |  Optional name to use for grouping all the gradient ops together. defaults to 'hessians'.   
Returns  
---  
A list of Hessian matrices of `sum(ys)` for each `x` in `xs`.  
Raises  
---  
`LookupError` |  if one of the operations between `xs` and `ys` does not have a registered gradient function.
