`tf.compat.v1.estimator.experimental.build_raw_supervised_input_receiver_fn`

    
    tf.estimator.experimental.build_raw_supervised_input_receiver_fn(
        features, labels, default_batch_size=None
    )
    
This function wraps tensor placeholders in a supervised_receiver_fn with the
expectation that the features and labels appear precisely as the model_fn
expects them. Features and labels can therefore be dicts of tensors, or raw
tensors.

Args  
---  
`features` |  a dict of string to `Tensor` or `Tensor`.   
`labels` |  a dict of string to `Tensor` or `Tensor`.   
`default_batch_size` |  the number of query examples expected per batch. Leave unset for variable batch size (recommended).   
Returns  
---  
A supervised_input_receiver_fn.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if features and labels have overlapping keys.
