`tf.compat.v1.estimator.experimental.stop_if_no_decrease_hook`

    
    tf.estimator.experimental.stop_if_no_decrease_hook(
        estimator, metric_name, max_steps_without_decrease, eval_dir=None, min_steps=0,
        run_every_secs=60, run_every_steps=None
    )
    
#### Usage example:

    
    estimator = ...
    # Hook to stop training if loss does not decrease in over 100000 steps.
    hook = early_stopping.stop_if_no_decrease_hook(estimator, "loss", 100000)
    train_spec = tf.estimator.TrainSpec(..., hooks=[hook])
    tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate(estimator, train_spec, ...)
    
Caveat: Current implementation supports early-stopping both training and evaluation in local mode. In distributed mode, training can be stopped but evaluation (where it's a separate job) will indefinitely wait for new model checkpoints to evaluate, so you will need other means to detect and stop it. Early-stopping evaluation in distributed mode requires changes in `train_and_evaluate` API and will be addressed in a future revision. | Args  
---  
`estimator` |  A `tf.estimator.Estimator` instance.   
`metric_name` |  `str`, metric to track. "loss", "accuracy", etc.   
`max_steps_without_decrease` |  `int`, maximum number of training steps with no decrease in the given metric.   
`eval_dir` |  If set, directory containing summary files with eval metrics. By default, `estimator.eval_dir()` will be used.   
`min_steps` |  `int`, stop is never requested if global step is less than this value. Defaults to 0.   
`run_every_secs` |  If specified, calls `should_stop_fn` at an interval of `run_every_secs` seconds. Defaults to 60 seconds. Either this or `run_every_steps` must be set.   
`run_every_steps` |  If specified, calls `should_stop_fn` every `run_every_steps` steps. Either this or `run_every_secs` must be set.   
Returns  
---  
An early-stopping hook of type `SessionRunHook` that periodically checks if
the given metric shows no decrease over given maximum number of training
steps, and initiates early stopping if true.
