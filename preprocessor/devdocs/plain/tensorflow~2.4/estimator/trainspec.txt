`tf.compat.v1.estimator.TrainSpec`

    
    tf.estimator.TrainSpec(
        input_fn, max_steps=None, hooks=None, saving_listeners=None
    )
    
`TrainSpec` determines the input data for the training, as well as the
duration. Optional hooks run at various stages of training.

#### Usage:

    
    train_spec = tf.estimator.TrainSpec(
       input_fn=lambda: 1,
       max_steps=100,
       hooks=[_StopAtSecsHook(stop_after_secs=10)],
       saving_listeners=[_NewCheckpointListenerForEvaluate(None, 20, None)])
    train_spec.saving_listeners[0]._eval_throttle_secs
    20
    train_spec.hooks[0]._stop_after_secs
    10
    train_spec.max_steps
    100
    
| Args  
---  
`input_fn` |  A function that provides input data for training as minibatches. See Premade Estimators for more information. The function should construct and return one of the following: 
  * A 'tf.data.Dataset' object: Outputs of `Dataset` object must be a tuple (features, labels) with same constraints as below.
  * A tuple (features, labels): Where features is a `Tensor` or a dictionary of string feature name to `Tensor` and labels is a `Tensor` or a dictionary of string label name to `Tensor`. 

  
`max_steps` |  Int. Positive number of total steps for which to train model. If `None`, train forever. The training `input_fn` is not expected to generate `OutOfRangeError` or `StopIteration` exceptions. See the `train_and_evaluate` stop condition section for details.   
`hooks` |  Iterable of `tf.train.SessionRunHook` objects to run on all workers (including chief) during training.   
`saving_listeners` |  Iterable of `tf.estimator.CheckpointSaverListener` objects to run on chief during training.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If any of the input arguments is invalid.   
`TypeError` |  If any of the arguments is not of the expected type.
