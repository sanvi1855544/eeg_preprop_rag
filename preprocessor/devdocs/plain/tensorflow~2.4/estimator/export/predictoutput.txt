    tf.estimator.export.PredictOutput(
        outputs
    )
    
A generic prediction need not be either a classification or a regression. Named outputs must be provided as a dict from string to `Tensor`, | Args  
---  
`outputs` |  A `Tensor` or a dict of string to `Tensor` representing the predictions.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if the outputs is not dict, or any of its keys are not strings, or any of its values are not `Tensor`s.   
Attributes  
---  
`outputs` |   
## Methods

### `as_signature_def`

View source

    
    as_signature_def(
        receiver_tensors
    )
    
Generate a SignatureDef proto for inclusion in a MetaGraphDef.

The SignatureDef will specify outputs as described in this ExportOutput, and
will use the provided receiver_tensors as inputs.

Args  
---  
`receiver_tensors` |  a `Tensor`, or a dict of string to `Tensor`, specifying input nodes that will be fed.
