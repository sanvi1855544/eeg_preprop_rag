`tf.compat.v1.estimator.export.TensorServingInputReceiver`

    
    tf.estimator.export.TensorServingInputReceiver(
        features, receiver_tensors, receiver_tensors_alternatives=None
    )
    
This is for use with models that expect a single `Tensor` or `SparseTensor` as an input feature, as opposed to a dict of features. The normal `ServingInputReceiver` always returns a feature dict, even if it contains only one entry, and so can be used only with models that accept such a dict. For models that accept only a single raw feature, the `serving_input_receiver_fn` provided to `Estimator.export_saved_model()` should return this `TensorServingInputReceiver` instead. See: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/11674 Note that the receiver_tensors and receiver_tensor_alternatives arguments will be automatically converted to the dict representation in either case, because the SavedModel format requires each input `Tensor` to have a name (provided by the dict key). | Attributes  
---  
`features` |  A single `Tensor` or `SparseTensor`, representing the feature to be passed to the model.   
`receiver_tensors` |  A `Tensor`, `SparseTensor`, or dict of string to `Tensor` or `SparseTensor`, specifying input nodes where this receiver expects to be fed by default. Typically, this is a single placeholder expecting serialized `tf.Example` protos.   
`receiver_tensors_alternatives` |  a dict of string to additional groups of receiver tensors, each of which may be a `Tensor`, `SparseTensor`, or dict of string to `Tensor` or`SparseTensor`. These named receiver tensor alternatives generate additional serving signatures, which may be used to feed inputs at different points within the input receiver subgraph. A typical usage is to allow feeding raw feature `Tensor`s downstream of the tf.parse_example() op. Defaults to None.
