`tf.compat.v1.train.CheckpointOptions`

    
    tf.train.CheckpointOptions(
        experimental_io_device=None
    )
    
Used as the `_options` argument to the `tf.Checkpoint` constructor to adjust
how variables are saved.

Example: Run IO ops on "localhost" while saving a checkpoint:

    
    step = tf.Variable(0, name="step")
    checkpoint = tf.Checkpoint(step=step)
    options = tf.CheckpointOptions(experimental_io_device="/job:localhost")
    checkpoint.save("/tmp/ckpt", options=options)
    
Args  
---  
`experimental_io_device` |  string. Applies in a distributed setting. Tensorflow device to use to access the filesystem. If `None` (default) then for each variable the filesystem is accessed from the CPU:0 device of the host where that variable is assigned. If specified, the filesystem is instead accessed from that device for all variables. This is for example useful if you want to save to a local directory, such as "/tmp" when running in a distributed setting. In that case pass a device for the host where the "/tmp" directory is accessible.
