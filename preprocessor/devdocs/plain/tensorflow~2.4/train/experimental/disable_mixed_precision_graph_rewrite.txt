View source on GitHub  Disables the mixed precision graph rewrite.
(deprecated)

    
    tf.train.experimental.disable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed after 2020-11-30.
Instructions for updating: Use tf.keras.mixed_precision. There is a guide at
https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/mixed_precision. Alternatively,
`tf.compat.v1.mixed_precision.disable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite` can be
used, but this is not recommended for TF2 code. After this is called, the
mixed precision graph rewrite will no longer run for tf.functions, and so
float32 operations will no longer be converted to float16. This does not undo
the effects of loss scaling. Any optimizers wrapped with a LossScaleOptimizer
will continue to do loss scaling, although this loss scaling will no longer be
useful, as the graph rewrite no longer converts tf.functions to use float16.
This function is useful for unit testing. A unit test can test using the mixed
precision graph rewrite, then disable it so future unit tests continue using
float32. Â© 2020 The TensorFlow Authors. All rights reserved.
