    tf.graph_util.import_graph_def(

Warning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(op_dict)`. They will be removed in a future version. Instructions for updating: Please file an issue at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues if you depend on this feature. This function provides a way to import a serialized TensorFlow `GraphDef` protocol buffer, and extract individual objects in the `GraphDef` as `tf.Tensor` and `tf.Operation` objects. Once extracted, these objects are placed into the current default `Graph`. See `tf.Graph.as_graph_def` for a way to create a `GraphDef` proto. | Args  
---  
`graph_def` |  A `GraphDef` proto containing operations to be imported into the default graph.   
`input_map` |  A dictionary mapping input names (as strings) in `graph_def` to `Tensor` objects. The values of the named input tensors in the imported graph will be re-mapped to the respective `Tensor` values.   
`return_elements` |  A list of strings containing operation names in `graph_def` that will be returned as `Operation` objects; and/or tensor names in `graph_def` that will be returned as `Tensor` objects.   
`name` |  (Optional.) A prefix that will be prepended to the names in `graph_def`. Note that this does not apply to imported function names. Defaults to `"import"`.   
`op_dict` |  (Optional.) Deprecated, do not use.   
`producer_op_list` |  (Optional.) An `OpList` proto with the (possibly stripped) list of `OpDef`s used by the producer of the graph. If provided, unrecognized attrs for ops in `graph_def` that have their default value according to `producer_op_list` will be removed. This will allow some more `GraphDef`s produced by later binaries to be accepted by earlier binaries.   
Returns  
---  
A list of `Operation` and/or `Tensor` objects from the imported graph,
corresponding to the names in `return_elements`, and None if
`returns_elements` is None.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `graph_def` is not a `GraphDef` proto, `input_map` is not a dictionary mapping strings to `Tensor` objects, or `return_elements` is not a list of strings.   
`ValueError` |  If `input_map`, or `return_elements` contains names that do not appear in `graph_def`, or `graph_def` is not well-formed (e.g. it refers to an unknown tensor).
