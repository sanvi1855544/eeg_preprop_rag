    tf.recompute_grad(
        f
    )
    
For f(*args, **kwargs), this supports gradients with respect to args or kwargs, but kwargs are currently only supported in eager-mode. Note that for keras layer and model objects, this is handled automatically. Warning: If `f` was originally a tf.keras Model or Layer object, `g` will not be able to access the member variables of that object, because `g` returns through the wrapper function `inner`. When recomputing gradients through objects that inherit from keras, we suggest keeping a reference to the underlying object around for the purpose of accessing these variables. | Args  
---  
`f` |  function `f(*x)` that returns a `Tensor` or sequence of `Tensor` outputs.   
Returns  
---  
A function `g` that wraps `f`, but which recomputes `f` on the backwards pass
of a gradient call.
