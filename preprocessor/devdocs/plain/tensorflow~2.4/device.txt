# tf.device

View source on GitHub  Specifies the device for ops created/executed in this
context.

    
    tf.device(
        device_name
    )
    
This function specifies the device to be used for ops created/executed in a
particular context. Nested contexts will inherit and also create/execute their
ops on the specified device. If a specific device is not required, consider
not using this function so that a device can be automatically assigned. In
general the use of this function is optional. `device_name` can be fully
specified, as in "/job:worker/task:1/device:cpu:0", or partially specified,
containing only a subset of the "/"-separated fields. Any fields which are
specified will override device annotations from outer scopes.

#### For example:

    
    with tf.device('/job:foo'):
      # ops created here have devices with /job:foo
      with tf.device('/job:bar/task:0/device:gpu:2'):
        # ops created here have the fully specified device above
      with tf.device('/device:gpu:1'):
        # ops created here have the device '/job:foo/device:gpu:1'
