    tf.no_gradient(
        op_type
    )
    
This function should not be used for operations that have a well-defined
gradient that is not yet implemented. This function is only used when defining
a new op type. It may be used for ops such as `tf.size()` that are not
differentiable. For example:

    
    tf.no_gradient("Size")
    
The gradient computed for 'op_type' will then propagate zeros. For ops that have a well-defined gradient but are not yet implemented, no declaration should be made, and an error must be thrown if an attempt to request its gradient is made. | Args  
---  
`op_type` |  The string type of an operation. This corresponds to the `OpDef.name` field for the proto that defines the operation.   
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `op_type` is not a string.
