`tf.compat.v1.argsort`

    
    tf.argsort(
        values, axis=-1, direction='ASCENDING', stable=False, name=None
    )
    
For a 1D tensor, `tf.gather(values, tf.argsort(values))` is equivalent to
`tf.sort(values)`. For higher dimensions, the output has the same shape as
`values`, but along the given axis, values represent the index of the sorted
element in that slice of the tensor at the given position.

#### Usage:

    
    import tensorflow as tf
    a = [1, 10, 26.9, 2.8, 166.32, 62.3]
    b = tf.argsort(a,axis=-1,direction='ASCENDING',stable=False,name=None)
    c = tf.keras.backend.eval(b)
    # Here, c = [0 3 1 2 5 4]
    
| Args  
---  
`values` |  1-D or higher numeric `Tensor`.   
`axis` |  The axis along which to sort. The default is -1, which sorts the last axis.   
`direction` |  The direction in which to sort the values (`'ASCENDING'` or `'DESCENDING'`).   
`stable` |  If True, equal elements in the original tensor will not be re-ordered in the returned order. Unstable sort is not yet implemented, but will eventually be the default for performance reasons. If you require a stable order, pass `stable=True` for forwards compatibility.   
`name` |  Optional name for the operation.   
Returns  
---  
An int32 `Tensor` with the same shape as `values`. The indices that would sort
each slice of the given `values` along the given `axis`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If axis is not a constant scalar, or the direction is invalid.
