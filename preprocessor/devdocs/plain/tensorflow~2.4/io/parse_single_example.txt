# tf.io.parse_single_example

View source on GitHub  Parses a single `Example` proto.

    
    tf.io.parse_single_example(
        serialized, features, example_names=None, name=None
    )
    
Similar to `parse_example`, except: For dense tensors, the returned `Tensor` is identical to the output of `parse_example`, except there is no batch dimension, the output shape is the same as the shape given in `dense_shape`. For `SparseTensor`s, the first (batch) column of the indices matrix is removed (the indices matrix is a column vector), the values vector is unchanged, and the first (`batch_size`) entry of the shape vector is removed (it is now a single element vector). One might see performance advantages by batching `Example` protos with `parse_example` instead of using this function directly. | Args  
---  
`serialized` |  A scalar string Tensor, a single serialized Example.   
`features` |  A `dict` mapping feature keys to `FixedLenFeature` or `VarLenFeature` values.   
`example_names` |  (Optional) A scalar string Tensor, the associated name.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `dict` mapping feature keys to `Tensor` and `SparseTensor` values.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if any feature is invalid.
