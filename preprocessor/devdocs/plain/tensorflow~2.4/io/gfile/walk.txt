`tf.compat.v1.io.gfile.walk`

    
    tf.io.gfile.walk(
        top, topdown=True, onerror=None
    )
    
| Args  
---  
`top` |  string, a Directory name   
`topdown` |  bool, Traverse pre order if True, post order if False.   
`onerror` |  optional handler for errors. Should be a function, it will be called with the error as argument. Rethrowing the error aborts the walk. Errors that happen while listing directories are ignored.   
Yields  
---  
Each yield is a 3-tuple: the pathname of a directory, followed by lists of all
its subdirectories and leaf files. That is, each yield looks like: `(dirname,
[subdirname, subdirname, ...], [filename, filename, ...])`. Each item is a
string.
