    tf.io.write_graph(
        graph_or_graph_def, logdir, name, as_text=True
    )
    
The graph is written as a text proto unless `as_text` is `False`.

    
    v = tf.Variable(0, name='my_variable')
    sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()
    tf.io.write_graph(sess.graph_def, '/tmp/my-model', 'train.pbtxt')
    
or

    
    v = tf.Variable(0, name='my_variable')
    sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()
    tf.io.write_graph(sess.graph, '/tmp/my-model', 'train.pbtxt')
