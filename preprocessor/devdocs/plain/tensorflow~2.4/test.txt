# Module: tf.test

Testing.

## Classes

`class Benchmark`: Abstract class that provides helpers for TensorFlow
benchmarks.

`class TestCase`: Base class for tests that need to test TensorFlow.

## Functions

`assert_equal_graph_def(...)`: Asserts that two `GraphDef`s are (mostly) the
same.

`benchmark_config(...)`: Returns a tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto for disabling the
dependency optimizer.

`compute_gradient(...)`: Computes the theoretical and numeric Jacobian of `f`.

`create_local_cluster(...)`: Create and start local servers and return the
associated `Server` objects.

`gpu_device_name(...)`: Returns the name of a GPU device if available or the
empty string.

`is_built_with_cuda(...)`: Returns whether TensorFlow was built with CUDA
(GPU) support.

`is_built_with_gpu_support(...)`: Returns whether TensorFlow was built with
GPU (i.e. CUDA or ROCm) support.

`is_built_with_rocm(...)`: Returns whether TensorFlow was built with ROCm
(GPU) support.

`is_built_with_xla(...)`: Returns whether TensorFlow was built with XLA
support.

`is_gpu_available(...)`: Returns whether TensorFlow can access a GPU.
