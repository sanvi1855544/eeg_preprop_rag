`tf.compat.v1.tpu.experimental.DeviceAssignment`

    
    tf.tpu.experimental.DeviceAssignment(
        topology, core_assignment
    )
    
Prefer to use the `DeviceAssignment.build()` helper to construct a `DeviceAssignment`; it is easier if less flexible than constructing a `DeviceAssignment` directly. | Args  
---  
`topology` |  A `Topology` object that describes the physical TPU topology.   
`core_assignment` |  A logical to physical core mapping, represented as a rank 3 numpy array. See the description of the `core_assignment` property for more details.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `topology` is not `Topology` object.   
`ValueError` |  If `core_assignment` is not a rank 3 numpy array.   
Attributes  
---  
`core_assignment` |  The logical to physical core mapping.   
`num_cores_per_replica` |  The number of cores per replica.   
`num_replicas` |  The number of replicas of the computation.   
`topology` |  A `Topology` that describes the TPU topology.   
## Methods

### `build`

View source

    
    @staticmethod
    build(
        topology, computation_shape=None, computation_stride=None, num_replicas=1
    )
    
### `coordinates`

View source

    
    coordinates(
        replica, logical_core
    )
    
Returns the physical topology coordinates of a logical core.

### `host_device`

View source

    
    host_device(
        replica=0, logical_core=0, job=None
    )
    
Returns the CPU device attached to a logical core.

### `lookup_replicas`

View source

    
    lookup_replicas(
        task_id, logical_core
    )
    
Lookup replica ids by task number and logical core.

Args  
---  
`task_id` |  TensorFlow task number.   
`logical_core` |  An integer, identifying a logical core.   
Returns  
---  
A sorted list of the replicas that are attached to that task and logical_core.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If no replica exists in the task which contains the logical core.   
### `tpu_device`

View source

    
    tpu_device(
        replica=0, logical_core=0, job=None
    )
    
Returns the name of the TPU device assigned to a logical core.

### `tpu_ordinal`

View source

    
    tpu_ordinal(
        replica=0, logical_core=0
    )
    
Returns the ordinal of the TPU device assigned to a logical core.
