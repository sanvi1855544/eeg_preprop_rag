`tf.compat.v1.tpu.experimental.embedding.SGD`

    
    tf.tpu.experimental.embedding.SGD(
        learning_rate: Union[float, Callable[[], float]] = 0.01,
        clip_weight_min: Optional[float] = None,
        clip_weight_max: Optional[float] = None,
        weight_decay_factor: Optional[float] = None,
        multiply_weight_decay_factor_by_learning_rate: bool = None,
        clipvalue: Optional[ClipValueType] = None
    )
    
Pass this to `tf.tpu.experimental.embedding.TPUEmbedding` via the `optimizer`
argument to set the global optimizer and its parameters:

    
    embedding = tf.tpu.experimental.embedding.TPUEmbedding(
        ...
        optimizer=tf.tpu.experimental.embedding.SGD(0.1))
    
This can also be used in a `tf.tpu.experimental.embedding.TableConfig` as the
optimizer parameter to set a table specific optimizer. This will override the
optimizer and parameters for global embedding optimizer defined above:

    
    table_one = tf.tpu.experimental.embedding.TableConfig(
        vocabulary_size=...,
        dim=...,
        optimizer=tf.tpu.experimental.embedding.SGD(0.2))
    table_two = tf.tpu.experimental.embedding.TableConfig(
        vocabulary_size=...,
        dim=...)
    
    feature_config = (
        tf.tpu.experimental.embedding.FeatureConfig(
            table=table_one),
        tf.tpu.experimental.embedding.FeatureConfig(
            table=table_two))
    
    embedding = tf.tpu.experimental.embedding.TPUEmbedding(
        feature_config=feature_config,
        batch_size=...
        optimizer=tf.tpu.experimental.embedding.SGD(0.1))
    
In the above example, the first feature will be looked up in a table that has
a learning rate of 0.2 while the second feature will be looked up in a table
that has a learning rate of 0.1.

See 'tensorflow/core/protobuf/tpu/optimization_parameters.proto' for a
complete description of these parameters and their impacts on the optimizer
algorithm.

Args  
---  
`learning_rate` |  The learning rate. It should be a floating point value or a callable taking no arguments for a dynamic learning rate.   
`clip_weight_min` |  the minimum value to clip by; None means -infinity.   
`clip_weight_max` |  the maximum value to clip by; None means +infinity.   
`weight_decay_factor` |  amount of weight decay to apply; None means that the weights are not decayed. Weights are decayed by multiplying the weight by this factor each step.   
`multiply_weight_decay_factor_by_learning_rate` |  if true, `weight_decay_factor` is multiplied by the current learning rate.   
`clipvalue` |  Controls clipping of the gradient. Set to either a single positive scalar value to get clipping or a tiple of scalar values (min, max) to set a separate maximum or minimum. If one of the two entries is None, then there will be no clipping that direction. Note if this is set, you may see a decrease in performance as gradient accumulation will be enabled (it is normally off for SGD as it has no affect on accuracy). See 'tensorflow/core/protobuf/tpu/optimization_parameters.proto' for more information on gradient accumulation and its impact on tpu embeddings.
