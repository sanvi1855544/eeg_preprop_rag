`tf.compat.v1.signal.inverse_stft_window_fn`

    
    tf.signal.inverse_stft_window_fn(
        frame_step, forward_window_fn=tf.signal.hann_window, name=None
    )
    
Constructs a window that is equal to the forward window with a further pointwise amplitude correction. `inverse_stft_window_fn` is equivalent to `forward_window_fn` in the case where it would produce an exact inverse. See examples in `inverse_stft` documentation for usage. | Args  
---  
`frame_step` |  An integer scalar `Tensor`. The number of samples to step.   
`forward_window_fn` |  window_fn used in the forward transform, `stft`.   
`name` |  An optional name for the operation.   
Returns  
---  
A callable that takes a window length and a `dtype` keyword argument and
returns a `[window_length]` `Tensor` of samples in the provided datatype. The
returned window is suitable for reconstructing original waveform in
inverse_stft.
