`tf.compat.v1.signal.overlap_and_add`

    
    tf.signal.overlap_and_add(
        signal, frame_step, name=None
    )
    
Adds potentially overlapping frames of a signal with shape `[..., frames,
frame_length]`, offsetting subsequent frames by `frame_step`. The resulting
tensor has shape `[..., output_size]` where

    
    output_size = (frames - 1) * frame_step + frame_length
    
| Args  
---  
`signal` |  A [..., frames, frame_length] `Tensor`. All dimensions may be unknown, and rank must be at least 2.   
`frame_step` |  An integer or scalar `Tensor` denoting overlap offsets. Must be less than or equal to `frame_length`.   
`name` |  An optional name for the operation.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` with shape `[..., output_size]` containing the overlap-added frames
of `signal`'s inner-most two dimensions.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `signal`'s rank is less than 2, or `frame_step` is not a scalar integer.
