    tf.signal.rfft(
        input_tensor, fft_length=None, name=None
    )
    
Computes the 1-dimensional discrete Fourier transform of a real-valued signal over the inner-most dimension of `input`. Since the DFT of a real signal is Hermitian-symmetric, `RFFT` only returns the `fft_length / 2 + 1` unique components of the FFT: the zero-frequency term, followed by the `fft_length / 2` positive-frequency terms. Along the axis `RFFT` is computed on, if `fft_length` is smaller than the corresponding dimension of `input`, the dimension is cropped. If it is larger, the dimension is padded with zeros. | Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`. A float32 tensor.   
`fft_length` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. An int32 tensor of shape [1]. The FFT length.   
`Tcomplex` |  An optional `tf.DType` from: `tf.complex64, tf.complex128`. Defaults to `tf.complex64`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `Tcomplex`.
