`tf.compat.v1.extract_volume_patches`

    
    tf.extract_volume_patches(
        input, ksizes, strides, padding, name=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `uint8`, `int16`, `int8`, `int64`, `bfloat16`, `uint16`, `half`, `uint32`, `uint64`. 5-D Tensor with shape `[batch, in_planes, in_rows, in_cols, depth]`.   
`ksizes` |  A list of `ints` that has length `>= 5`. The size of the sliding window for each dimension of `input`.   
`strides` |  A list of `ints` that has length `>= 5`. 1-D of length 5. How far the centers of two consecutive patches are in `input`. Must be: `[1, stride_planes, stride_rows, stride_cols, 1]`.   
`padding` |  A `string` from: `"SAME", "VALID"`. The type of padding algorithm to use. The size-related attributes are specified as follows:
    
    ksizes = [1, ksize_planes, ksize_rows, ksize_cols, 1]
    strides = [1, stride_planes, strides_rows, strides_cols, 1]
      
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
