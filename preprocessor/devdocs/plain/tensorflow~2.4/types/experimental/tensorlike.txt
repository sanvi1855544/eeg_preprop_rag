# tf.types.experimental.TensorLike

This symbol is a type alias.

Union of all types that can be converted to a `tf.Tensor` by
`tf.convert_to_tensor`.

#### Source:

    
    TensorLike = Union[
        tensorflow.python.types.core.Tensor,
        tensorflow.python.types.core.TensorProtocol,
        int,
        float,
        bool,
        str,
        complex,
        tuple,
        list,
        numpy.ndarray
    ]
    
This definition may be used in user code. Additional types may be added in the
future as more input types are supported.

#### Example:

    
    def foo(x: TensorLike):
      pass
    
This definition passes static type verification for:

    
    foo(tf.constant([1, 2, 3]))
    foo([1, 2, 3])
    foo(np.array([1, 2, 3]))
