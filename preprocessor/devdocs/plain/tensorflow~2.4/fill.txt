`tf.compat.v1.fill`

    
    tf.fill(
        dims, value, name=None
    )
    
See also `tf.ones`, `tf.zeros`, `tf.one_hot`, `tf.eye`. This operation creates
a tensor of shape `dims` and fills it with `value`.

#### For example:

    
    tf.fill([2, 3], 9)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 3), dtype=int32, numpy=
    array([[9, 9, 9],
           [9, 9, 9]], dtype=int32)>
    
`tf.fill` evaluates at graph runtime and supports dynamic shapes based on other runtime `tf.Tensors`, unlike `tf.constant(value, shape=dims)`, which embeds the value as a `Const` node. | Args  
---  
`dims` |  A 1-D sequence of non-negative numbers. Represents the shape of the output `tf.Tensor`. Entries should be of type: `int32`, `int64`.   
`value` |  A value to fill the returned `tf.Tensor`.   
`name` |  Optional string. The name of the output `tf.Tensor`.   
Returns  
---  
A `tf.Tensor` with shape `dims` and the same dtype as `value`.  
Raises  
---  
`InvalidArgumentError` |  `dims` contains negative entries.   
`NotFoundError` |  `dims` contains non-integer entries.   
#### Numpy Compatibility

Similar to `np.full`. In `numpy`, more parameters are supported. Passing a
number argument as the shape (`np.full(5, value)`) is valid in `numpy` for
specifying a 1-D shaped result, while TensorFlow does not support this syntax.
