    tf.GradientTape(
        persistent=False, watch_accessed_variables=True
    )
    
Operations are recorded if they are executed within this context manager and
at least one of their inputs is being "watched". Trainable variables (created
by `tf.Variable` or `tf.compat.v1.get_variable`, where `trainable=True` is
default in both cases) are automatically watched. Tensors can be manually
watched by invoking the `watch` method on this context manager. For example,
consider the function `y = x * x`. The gradient at `x = 3.0` can be computed
as:

    
    x = tf.constant(3.0)
    with tf.GradientTape() as g:
      g.watch(x)
      y = x * x
    dy_dx = g.gradient(y, x)
    print(dy_dx)
    tf.Tensor(6.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
    
GradientTapes can be nested to compute higher-order derivatives. For example,

    
    x = tf.constant(5.0)
    with tf.GradientTape() as g:
      g.watch(x)
      with tf.GradientTape() as gg:
        gg.watch(x)
        y = x * x
      dy_dx = gg.gradient(y, x)  # dy_dx = 2 * x
    d2y_dx2 = g.gradient(dy_dx, x)  # d2y_dx2 = 2
    print(dy_dx)
    tf.Tensor(10.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
    print(d2y_dx2)
    tf.Tensor(2.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
    
By default, the resources held by a GradientTape are released as soon as
GradientTape.gradient() method is called. To compute multiple gradients over
the same computation, create a persistent gradient tape. This allows multiple
calls to the gradient() method as resources are released when the tape object
is garbage collected. For example:

    
    x = tf.constant(3.0)
    with tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) as g:
      g.watch(x)
      y = x * x
      z = y * y
    dz_dx = g.gradient(z, x)  # (4*x^3 at x = 3)
    print(dz_dx)
    tf.Tensor(108.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
    dy_dx = g.gradient(y, x)
    print(dy_dx)
    tf.Tensor(6.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
    
By default GradientTape will automatically watch any trainable variables that
are accessed inside the context. If you want fine grained control over which
variables are watched you can disable automatic tracking by passing
`watch_accessed_variables=False` to the tape constructor:

    
    x = tf.Variable(2.0)
    w = tf.Variable(5.0)
    with tf.GradientTape(
        watch_accessed_variables=False, persistent=True) as tape:
      tape.watch(x)
      y = x ** 2  # Gradients will be available for `x`.
      z = w ** 3  # No gradients will be available as `w` isn't being watched.
    dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x)
    print(dy_dx)
    tf.Tensor(4.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
    # No gradients will be available as `w` isn't being watched.
    dz_dy = tape.gradient(z, w)
    print(dz_dy)
    None
    
Note that when using models you should ensure that your variables exist when
using `watch_accessed_variables=False`. Otherwise it's quite easy to make your
first iteration not have any gradients:

    
    a = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32)
    b = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32)
    
    with tf.GradientTape(watch_accessed_variables=False) as tape:
      tape.watch(a.variables)  # Since `a.build` has not been called at this point
                               # `a.variables` will return an empty list and the
                               # tape will not be watching anything.
      result = b(a(inputs))
      tape.gradient(result, a.variables)  # The result of this computation will be
                                          # a list of `None`s since a's variables
                                          # are not being watched.
    
Note that only tensors with real or complex dtypes are differentiable. | Args  
---  
`persistent` |  Boolean controlling whether a persistent gradient tape is created. False by default, which means at most one call can be made to the gradient() method on this object.   
`watch_accessed_variables` |  Boolean controlling whether the tape will automatically `watch` any (trainable) variables accessed while the tape is active. Defaults to True meaning gradients can be requested from any result computed in the tape derived from reading a trainable `Variable`. If False users must explicitly `watch` any `Variable`s they want to request gradients from.   
## Methods

### `batch_jacobian`

View source

    
    batch_jacobian(
        target, source, unconnected_gradients=tf.UnconnectedGradients.NONE,
        parallel_iterations=None, experimental_use_pfor=True
    )
    
Computes and stacks per-example jacobians.

See wikipedia article for the definition of a Jacobian. This function is
essentially an efficient implementation of the following:

`tf.stack([self.jacobian(y[i], x[i]) for i in range(x.shape[0])])`.

Note that compared to `GradientTape.jacobian` which computes gradient of each
output value w.r.t each input value, this function is useful when
`target[i,...]` is independent of `source[j,...]` for `j != i`. This
assumption allows more efficient computation as compared to
`GradientTape.jacobian`. The output, as well as intermediate activations, are
lower dimensional and avoid a bunch of redundant zeros which would result in
the jacobian computation given the independence assumption.

> Note: Unless you set `persistent=True` a GradientTape can only be used to
> compute one set of gradients (or jacobians).
#### Example usage:

    
    with tf.GradientTape() as g:
      x = tf.constant([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]], dtype=tf.float32)
      g.watch(x)
      y = x * x
    batch_jacobian = g.batch_jacobian(y, x)
    # batch_jacobian is [[[2,  0], [0,  4]], [[6,  0], [0,  8]]]
    
Args  
---  
`target` |  A tensor with rank 2 or higher and with shape [b, y1, ..., y_n]. `target[i,...]` should only depend on `source[i,...]`.   
`source` |  A tensor with rank 2 or higher and with shape [b, x1, ..., x_m].   
`unconnected_gradients` |  a value which can either hold 'none' or 'zero' and alters the value which will be returned if the target and sources are unconnected. The possible values and effects are detailed in 'UnconnectedGradients' and it defaults to 'none'.   
`parallel_iterations` |  A knob to control how many iterations are dispatched in parallel. This knob can be used to control the total memory usage.   
`experimental_use_pfor` |  If true, uses pfor for computing the Jacobian. Else uses a tf.while_loop.   
Returns  
---  
A tensor `t` with shape [b, y_1, ..., y_n, x1, ..., x_m] where `t[i, ...]` is
the jacobian of `target[i, ...]` w.r.t. `source[i, ...]`, i.e. stacked per-
example jacobians.  
Raises  
---  
`RuntimeError` |  If called on a used, non-persistent tape.   
`RuntimeError` |  If called on a non-persistent tape with eager execution enabled and without enabling experimental_use_pfor.   
`ValueError` |  If vectorization of jacobian computation fails or if first dimension of `target` and `source` do not match.   
### `gradient`

View source

    
    gradient(
        target, sources, output_gradients=None,
        unconnected_gradients=tf.UnconnectedGradients.NONE
    )
    
Computes the gradient using operations recorded in context of this tape.

> Note: Unless you set `persistent=True` a GradientTape can only be used to
> compute one set of gradients (or jacobians).
Args  
---  
`target` |  a list or nested structure of Tensors or Variables to be differentiated.   
`sources` |  a list or nested structure of Tensors or Variables. `target` will be differentiated against elements in `sources`.   
`output_gradients` |  a list of gradients, one for each element of target. Defaults to None.   
`unconnected_gradients` |  a value which can either hold 'none' or 'zero' and alters the value which will be returned if the target and sources are unconnected. The possible values and effects are detailed in 'UnconnectedGradients' and it defaults to 'none'.   
Returns  
---  
a list or nested structure of Tensors (or IndexedSlices, or None), one for
each element in `sources`. Returned structure is the same as the structure of
`sources`.  
Raises  
---  
`RuntimeError` |  If called on a used, non-persistent tape.   
`RuntimeError` |  If called inside the context of the tape.   
`ValueError` |  If the target is a variable or if unconnected gradients is called with an unknown value.   
### `jacobian`

View source

    
    jacobian(
        target, sources, unconnected_gradients=tf.UnconnectedGradients.NONE,
        parallel_iterations=None, experimental_use_pfor=True
    )
    
Computes the jacobian using operations recorded in context of this tape.

> compute one set of gradients (or jacobians).
Seewikipedia article for the definition of a Jacobian.

#### Example usage:

    
    with tf.GradientTape() as g:
      x  = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0])
      g.watch(x)
      y = x * x
    jacobian = g.jacobian(y, x)
    # jacobian value is [[2., 0.], [0., 4.]]
    
Args  
---  
`target` |  Tensor to be differentiated.   
`sources` |  a list or nested structure of Tensors or Variables. `target` will be differentiated against elements in `sources`.   
`unconnected_gradients` |  a value which can either hold 'none' or 'zero' and alters the value which will be returned if the target and sources are unconnected. The possible values and effects are detailed in 'UnconnectedGradients' and it defaults to 'none'.   
`parallel_iterations` |  A knob to control how many iterations are dispatched in parallel. This knob can be used to control the total memory usage.   
`experimental_use_pfor` |  If true, vectorizes the jacobian computation. Else falls back to a sequential while_loop. Vectorization can sometimes fail or lead to excessive memory usage. This option can be used to disable vectorization in such cases.   
Returns  
---  
A list or nested structure of Tensors (or None), one for each element in
`sources`. Returned structure is the same as the structure of `sources`. Note
if any gradient is sparse (IndexedSlices), jacobian function currently makes
it dense and returns a Tensor instead. This may change in the future.  
Raises  
---  
`RuntimeError` |  If called on a used, non-persistent tape.   
`RuntimeError` |  If called on a non-persistent tape with eager execution enabled and without enabling experimental_use_pfor.   
`ValueError` |  If vectorization of jacobian computation fails.   
### `reset`

View source

    
    reset()
    
Clears all information stored in this tape.

Equivalent to exiting and reentering the tape context manager with a new tape.
For example, the two following code blocks are equivalent:

    
    with tf.GradientTape() as t:
      loss = loss_fn()
    with tf.GradientTape() as t:
      loss += other_loss_fn()
    t.gradient(loss, ...)  # Only differentiates other_loss_fn, not loss_fn
    
    
    # The following is equivalent to the above
    with tf.GradientTape() as t:
      loss = loss_fn()
      t.reset()
      loss += other_loss_fn()
    t.gradient(loss, ...)  # Only differentiates other_loss_fn, not loss_fn
    
This is useful if you don't want to exit the context manager for the tape, or
can't because the desired reset point is inside a control flow construct:

    
    with tf.GradientTape() as t:
      loss = ...
      if loss > k:
        t.reset()
    
### `stop_recording`

View source

    
    @tf_contextlib.contextmanager
    stop_recording()
    
Temporarily stops recording operations on this tape.

Operations executed while this context manager is active will not be recorded
on the tape. This is useful for reducing the memory used by tracing all
computations.

#### For example:

    
    x = tf.constant(4.0)
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      with tape.stop_recording():
        y = x ** 2
    dy_dx = tape.gradient(y, x)
    print(dy_dx)
    None
    
Yields  
---  
None  
Raises  
---  
`RuntimeError` |  if the tape is not currently recording.   
### `watch`

View source

    
    watch(
        tensor
    )
    
Ensures that `tensor` is being traced by this tape.

Args  
---  
`tensor` |  a Tensor or list of Tensors.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if it encounters something that is not a tensor.   
### `watched_variables`

View source

    
    watched_variables()
    
Returns variables watched by this tape in order of construction.

### `__enter__`

View source

    
    __enter__()
    
Enters a context inside which operations are recorded on this tape.

### `__exit__`

View source

    
    __exit__(
        typ, value, traceback
    )
    
Exits the recording context, no further operations are traced.
