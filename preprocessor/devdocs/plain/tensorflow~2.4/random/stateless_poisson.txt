`tf.compat.v1.random.stateless_poisson`

    
    tf.random.stateless_poisson(
        shape, seed, lam, dtype=tf.dtypes.int32, name=None
    )
    
The generated values follow a Poisson distribution with specified rate
parameter.

This is a stateless version of `tf.random.poisson`: if run twice with the same
seeds and shapes, it will produce the same pseudorandom numbers. The output is
consistent across multiple runs on the same hardware, but may change between
versions of TensorFlow or on non-CPU/GPU hardware.

A slight difference exists in the interpretation of the `shape` parameter
between `stateless_poisson` and `poisson`: in `poisson`, the `shape` is always
prepended to the shape of `lam`; whereas in `stateless_poisson` the shape of
`lam` must match the trailing dimensions of `shape`.

#### Example:

    
    samples = tf.random.stateless_poisson([10, 2], seed=[12, 34], lam=[5, 15])
    # samples has shape [10, 2], where each slice [:, 0] and [:, 1] represents
    # the samples drawn from each distribution
    
    samples = tf.random.stateless_poisson([7, 5, 2], seed=[12, 34], lam=[5, 15])
    # samples has shape [7, 5, 2], where each slice [:, :, 0] and [:, :, 1]
    # represents the 7x5 samples drawn from each of the two distributions
    
    rate = tf.constant([[1.], [3.], [5.]])
    samples = tf.random.stateless_poisson([30, 3, 1], seed=[12, 34], lam=rate)
    # samples has shape [30, 3, 1], with 30 samples each of 3x1 distributions.
    
Args  
---  
`shape` |  A 1-D integer Tensor or Python array. The shape of the output tensor.   
`seed` |  A shape [2] Tensor, the seed to the random number generator. Must have dtype `int32` or `int64`. (When using XLA, only `int32` is allowed.)   
`lam` |  Tensor. The rate parameter "lambda" of the Poisson distribution. Shape must match the rightmost dimensions of `shape`.   
`dtype` |  Dtype of the samples (int or float dtypes are permissible, as samples are discrete). Default: int32.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
`samples` |  A Tensor of the specified shape filled with random Poisson values. For each i, each `samples[..., i]` is an independent draw from the Poisson distribution with rate `lam[i]`.
