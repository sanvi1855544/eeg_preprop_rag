`tf.compat.v1.random.stateless_uniform`

    
    tf.random.stateless_uniform(
        shape, seed, minval=0, maxval=None, dtype=tf.dtypes.float32, name=None
    )
    
This is a stateless version of `tf.random.uniform`: if run twice with the same
seeds and shapes, it will produce the same pseudorandom numbers. The output is
consistent across multiple runs on the same hardware (and between CPU and
GPU), but may change between versions of TensorFlow or on non-CPU/GPU
hardware. The generated values follow a uniform distribution in the range
`[minval, maxval)`. The lower bound `minval` is included in the range, while
the upper bound `maxval` is excluded. For floats, the default range is `[0,
1)`. For ints, at least `maxval` must be specified explicitly. In the integer
case, the random integers are slightly biased unless `maxval - minval` is an
exact power of two. The bias is small for values of `maxval - minval`
significantly smaller than the range of the output (either `2**32` or
`2**64`). For full-range (i.e. inclusive of both max and min) random integers,
pass `minval=None` and `maxval=None` with an integer `dtype`. For an integer
dtype either both `minval` and `maxval` must be `None` or neither may be
`None`. For example:

    
    ints = tf.random.stateless_uniform(
        [10], seed=(2, 3), minval=None, maxval=None, dtype=tf.int32)
    
| Args  
---  
`shape` |  A 1-D integer Tensor or Python array. The shape of the output tensor.   
`seed` |  A shape [2] Tensor, the seed to the random number generator. Must have dtype `int32` or `int64`. (When using XLA, only `int32` is allowed.)   
`minval` |  A Tensor or Python value of type `dtype`, broadcastable with `shape` (for integer types, broadcasting is not supported, so it needs to be a scalar). The lower bound on the range of random values to generate. Pass `None` for full-range integers. Defaults to 0.   
`maxval` |  A Tensor or Python value of type `dtype`, broadcastable with `shape` (for integer types, broadcasting is not supported, so it needs to be a scalar). The upper bound on the range of random values to generate. Defaults to 1 if `dtype` is floating point. Pass `None` for full-range integers.   
`dtype` |  The type of the output: `float16`, `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, or `int64`. For unbounded uniform ints (`minval`, `maxval` both `None`), `uint32` and `uint64` may be used.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tensor of the specified shape filled with random uniform values.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `dtype` is integral and only one of `minval` or `maxval` is specified.
