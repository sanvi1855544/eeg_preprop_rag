    tf.random.shuffle(
        value, seed=None, name=None
    )
    
The tensor is shuffled along dimension 0, such that each `value[j]` is mapped
to one and only one `output[i]`. For example, a mapping that might occur for a
3x2 tensor is:

    
    [[1, 2],       [[5, 6],
     [3, 4],  ==>   [1, 2],
     [5, 6]]        [3, 4]]
    
| Args  
---  
`value` |  A Tensor to be shuffled.   
`seed` |  A Python integer. Used to create a random seed for the distribution. See `tf.random.set_seed` for behavior.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tensor of same shape and type as `value`, shuffled along its first
dimension.
