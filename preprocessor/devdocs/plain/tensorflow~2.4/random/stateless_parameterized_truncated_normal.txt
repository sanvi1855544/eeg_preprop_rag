`tf.compat.v1.random.stateless_parameterized_truncated_normal`

    
    tf.random.stateless_parameterized_truncated_normal(
        shape, seed, means=0.0, stddevs=1.0, minvals=-2.0, maxvals=2.0, name=None
    )
    
The generated values follow a normal distribution with specified mean and
standard deviation, except that values whose magnitude is more than 2 standard
deviations from the mean are dropped and re-picked.

#### Examples:

Sample from a Truncated normal, with deferring shape parameters that
broadcast.

    
    means = 0.
    stddevs = tf.math.exp(tf.random.uniform(shape=[2, 3]))
    minvals = [-1., -2., -1000.]
    maxvals = [[10000.], [1.]]
    y = tf.random.stateless_parameterized_truncated_normal(
      shape=[10, 2, 3], seed=[7, 17],
      means=means, stddevs=stddevs, minvals=minvals, maxvals=maxvals)
    y.shape
    TensorShape([10, 2, 3])
    
Args  
---  
`shape` |  A 1-D integer `Tensor` or Python array. The shape of the output tensor.   
`seed` |  A shape [2] Tensor, the seed to the random number generator. Must have dtype `int32` or `int64`. (When using XLA, only `int32` is allowed.)   
`means` |  A `Tensor` or Python value of type `dtype`. The mean of the truncated normal distribution. This must broadcast with `stddevs`, `minvals` and `maxvals`, and the broadcasted shape must be dominated by `shape`.   
`stddevs` |  A `Tensor` or Python value of type `dtype`. The standard deviation of the truncated normal distribution. This must broadcast with `means`, `minvals` and `maxvals`, and the broadcasted shape must be dominated by `shape`.   
`minvals` |  A `Tensor` or Python value of type `dtype`. The minimum value of the truncated normal distribution. This must broadcast with `means`, `stddevs` and `maxvals`, and the broadcasted shape must be dominated by `shape`.   
`maxvals` |  A `Tensor` or Python value of type `dtype`. The maximum value of the truncated normal distribution. This must broadcast with `means`, `stddevs` and `minvals`, and the broadcasted shape must be dominated by `shape`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tensor of the specified shape filled with random truncated normal values.
