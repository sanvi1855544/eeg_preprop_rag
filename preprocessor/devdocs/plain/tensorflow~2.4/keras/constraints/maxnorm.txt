    tf.keras.constraints.MaxNorm(
        max_value=2, axis=0
    )
    
Constrains the weights incident to each hidden unit to have a norm less than or equal to a desired value. Also available via the shortcut function `tf.keras.constraints.max_norm`. | Arguments  
---  
`max_value` |  the maximum norm value for the incoming weights.   
`axis` |  integer, axis along which to calculate weight norms. For instance, in a `Dense` layer the weight matrix has shape `(input_dim, output_dim)`, set `axis` to `0` to constrain each weight vector of length `(input_dim,)`. In a `Conv2D` layer with `data_format="channels_last"`, the weight tensor has shape `(rows, cols, input_depth, output_depth)`, set `axis` to `[0, 1, 2]` to constrain the weights of each filter tensor of size `(rows, cols, input_depth)`.
