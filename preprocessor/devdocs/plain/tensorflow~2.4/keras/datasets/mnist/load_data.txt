    tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(
        path='mnist.npz'
    )
    
This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits, along with a test set of 10,000 images. More info can be found at the MNIST homepage. | Arguments  
---  
`path` |  path where to cache the dataset locally (relative to `~/.keras/datasets`).   
Returns  
---  
Tuple of Numpy arrays: `(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test)`. x_train,
x_test: uint8 arrays of grayscale image data with shapes (num_samples, 28,
28). y_train, y_test: uint8 arrays of digit labels (integers in range 0-9)
with shapes (num_samples,).
