    tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist.load_data()
    
This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, along with a test set of 10,000 images. This dataset can be used as a drop-in replacement for MNIST. The class labels are: | Label | Description  
---|---  
0 | T-shirt/top  
1 | Trouser  
2 | Pullover

8 | Bag  
9 | Ankle boot  
Returns  
---  
Tuple of Numpy arrays: `(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test)`. x_train,
x_test: uint8 arrays of grayscale image data with shape (num_samples, 28, 28).
y_train, y_test: uint8 arrays of labels (integers in range 0-9) with shape
(num_samples,).
