View source on GitHub  Permutes the dimensions of the input according to a
given pattern. Inherits From: `Layer`, `Module`

`tf.compat.v1.keras.layers.Permute`

    
    tf.keras.layers.Permute(
        dims, **kwargs
    )
    
Useful e.g. connecting RNNs and convnets.

#### Example:

    
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Permute((2, 1), input_shape=(10, 64)))
    # now: model.output_shape == (None, 64, 10)
    # note: `None` is the batch dimension
    
| Arguments  
---  
`dims` |  Tuple of integers. Permutation pattern does not include the samples dimension. Indexing starts at 1. For instance, `(2, 1)` permutes the first and second dimensions of the input.   
#### Input shape:

Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument `input_shape` (tuple of integers, does not
include the samples axis) when using this layer as the first layer in a model.

#### Output shape:

Same as the input shape, but with the dimensions re-ordered according to the
specified pattern.
