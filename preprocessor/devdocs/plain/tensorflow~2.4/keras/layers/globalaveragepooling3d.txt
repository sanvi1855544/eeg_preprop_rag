    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling3D(
        data_format=None, **kwargs
    )
    
| Arguments  
---  
`data_format` |  A string, one of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. `channels_last` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3, channels)` while `channels_first` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch, channels, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3)`. It defaults to the `image_data_format` value found in your Keras config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`. If you never set it, then it will be "channels_last".   
#### Input shape:

  * If `data_format='channels_last'`: 5D tensor with shape: `(batch_size, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3, channels)`
  * If `data_format='channels_first'`: 5D tensor with shape: `(batch_size, channels, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3)`

#### Output shape:

2D tensor with shape `(batch_size, channels)`.
