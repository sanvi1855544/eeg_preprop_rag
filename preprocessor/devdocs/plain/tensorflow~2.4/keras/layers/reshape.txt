`tf.compat.v1.keras.layers.Reshape`

    
    tf.keras.layers.Reshape(
        target_shape, **kwargs
    )
    
#### Input shape:

Arbitrary, although all dimensions in the input shape must be known/fixed. Use
the keyword argument `input_shape` (tuple of integers, does not include the
samples/batch size axis) when using this layer as the first layer in a model.

#### Output shape:

`(batch_size,) + target_shape`

#### Example:

    
    # as first layer in a Sequential model
    model = tf.keras.Sequential()
    model.add(tf.keras.layers.Reshape((3, 4), input_shape=(12,)))
    # model.output_shape == (None, 3, 4), `None` is the batch size.
    model.output_shape
    (None, 3, 4)
    
    
    # as intermediate layer in a Sequential model
    model.add(tf.keras.layers.Reshape((6, 2)))
    model.output_shape
    (None, 6, 2)
    
    
    # also supports shape inference using `-1` as dimension
    model.add(tf.keras.layers.Reshape((-1, 2, 2)))
    model.output_shape
    (None, 3, 2, 2)
    
| Args  
---  
`target_shape` |  Target shape. Tuple of integers, does not include the samples dimension (batch size).   
`**kwargs` |  Any additional layer keyword arguments.
