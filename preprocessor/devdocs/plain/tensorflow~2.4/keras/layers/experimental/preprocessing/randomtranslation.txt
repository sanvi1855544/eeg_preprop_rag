`tf.compat.v1.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.RandomTranslation`

    
    tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.RandomTranslation(
        height_factor, width_factor, fill_mode='reflect',
        interpolation='bilinear', seed=None, name=None, fill_value=0.0,
        **kwargs
    )
    
Arguments  
---  
`height_factor` |  a float represented as fraction of value, or a tuple of size 2 representing lower and upper bound for shifting vertically. A negative value means shifting image up, while a positive value means shifting image down. When represented as a single positive float, this value is used for both the upper and lower bound. For instance, `height_factor=(-0.2, 0.3)` results in an output shifted by a random amount in the range [-20%, +30%]. `height_factor=0.2` results in an output height shifted by a random amount in the range [-20%, +20%].   
`width_factor` |  a float represented as fraction of value, or a tuple of size 2 representing lower and upper bound for shifting horizontally. A negative value means shifting image left, while a positive value means shifting image right. When represented as a single positive float, this value is used for both the upper and lower bound. For instance, `width_factor=(-0.2, 0.3)` results in an output shifted left by 20%, and shifted right by 30%. `width_factor=0.2` results in an output height shifted left or right by 20%.   
`fill_mode` |  Points outside the boundaries of the input are filled according to the given mode (one of `{'constant', 'reflect', 'wrap', 'nearest'}`). 
  * reflect: `(d c b a | a b c d | d c b a)` The input is extended by reflecting about the edge of the last pixel.
  * constant: `(k k k k | a b c d | k k k k)` The input is extended by filling all values beyond the edge with the same constant value k = 0.
  * wrap: `(a b c d | a b c d | a b c d)` The input is extended by wrapping around to the opposite edge.
  * nearest: `(a a a a | a b c d | d d d d)` The input is extended by the nearest pixel. 

  
`interpolation` |  Interpolation mode. Supported values: "nearest", "bilinear".   
`seed` |  Integer. Used to create a random seed.   
`name` |  A string, the name of the layer.   
`fill_value` |  a float represents the value to be filled outside the boundaries when `fill_mode` is "constant".   
#### Input shape:

4D tensor with shape: `(samples, height, width, channels)`,
data_format='channels_last'.

#### Output shape:

4D tensor with shape: `(samples, height, width, channels)`,
data_format='channels_last'.

Raise  
---  
`ValueError` |  if either bound is not between [0, 1], or upper bound is less than lower bound.   
## Methods

### `adapt`

View source

    
    adapt(
        data, reset_state=True
    )
    
Fits the state of the preprocessing layer to the data being passed.

Arguments  
---  
`data` |  The data to train on. It can be passed either as a tf.data Dataset, or as a numpy array.   
`reset_state` |  Optional argument specifying whether to clear the state of the layer at the start of the call to `adapt`, or whether to start from the existing state. This argument may not be relevant to all preprocessing layers: a subclass of PreprocessingLayer may choose to throw if 'reset_state' is set to False.
