    tf.keras.layers.AveragePooling3D(
        pool_size=(2, 2, 2), strides=None, padding='valid', data_format=None,
        **kwargs
    )
    
| Arguments  
---  
`pool_size` |  tuple of 3 integers, factors by which to downscale (dim1, dim2, dim3). `(2, 2, 2)` will halve the size of the 3D input in each dimension.   
`strides` |  tuple of 3 integers, or None. Strides values.   
`padding` |  One of `"valid"` or `"same"` (case-insensitive). `"valid"` means no padding. `"same"` results in padding evenly to the left/right or up/down of the input such that output has the same height/width dimension as the input.   
`data_format` |  A string, one of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. `channels_last` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3, channels)` while `channels_first` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch, channels, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3)`. It defaults to the `image_data_format` value found in your Keras config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`. If you never set it, then it will be "channels_last".   
#### Input shape:

  * If `data_format='channels_last'`: 5D tensor with shape: `(batch_size, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3, channels)`
  * If `data_format='channels_first'`: 5D tensor with shape: `(batch_size, channels, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3)`

#### Output shape:

  * If `data_format='channels_last'`: 5D tensor with shape: `(batch_size, pooled_dim1, pooled_dim2, pooled_dim3, channels)`
  * If `data_format='channels_first'`: 5D tensor with shape: `(batch_size, channels, pooled_dim1, pooled_dim2, pooled_dim3)`
