    tf.keras.layers.UpSampling3D(
        size=(2, 2, 2), data_format=None, **kwargs
    )
    
Repeats the 1st, 2nd and 3rd dimensions of the data by `size[0]`, `size[1]`
and `size[2]` respectively.

#### Examples:

    
    input_shape = (2, 1, 2, 1, 3)
    x = tf.constant(1, shape=input_shape)
    y = tf.keras.layers.UpSampling3D(size=2)(x)
    print(y.shape)
    (2, 2, 4, 2, 3)
    
| Arguments  
---  
`size` |  Int, or tuple of 3 integers. The upsampling factors for dim1, dim2 and dim3.   
`data_format` |  A string, one of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. `channels_last` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch_size, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3, channels)` while `channels_first` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch_size, channels, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3)`. It defaults to the `image_data_format` value found in your Keras config file at `~/.keras/keras.json`. If you never set it, then it will be "channels_last".   
#### Input shape:

5D tensor with shape:

  * If `data_format` is `"channels_last"`: `(batch_size, dim1, dim2, dim3, channels)`
  * If `data_format` is `"channels_first"`: `(batch_size, channels, dim1, dim2, dim3)`

#### Output shape:

5D tensor with shape:

  * If `data_format` is `"channels_last"`: `(batch_size, upsampled_dim1, upsampled_dim2, upsampled_dim3, channels)`
  * If `data_format` is `"channels_first"`: `(batch_size, channels, upsampled_dim1, upsampled_dim2, upsampled_dim3)`
