`tf.compat.v1.keras.layers.GaussianDropout`

    
    tf.keras.layers.GaussianDropout(
        rate, **kwargs
    )
    
As it is a regularization layer, it is only active at training time. | Arguments  
---  
`rate` |  Float, drop probability (as with `Dropout`). The multiplicative noise will have standard deviation `sqrt(rate / (1 - rate))`.   
#### Call arguments:

  * `inputs`: Input tensor (of any rank).
  * `training`: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in training mode (adding dropout) or in inference mode (doing nothing).

#### Input shape:

Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument `input_shape` (tuple of integers, does not
include the samples axis) when using this layer as the first layer in a model.

#### Output shape:

Same shape as input.
