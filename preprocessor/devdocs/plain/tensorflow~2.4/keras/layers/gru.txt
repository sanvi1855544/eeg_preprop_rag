See the Keras RNN API guide for details about the usage of RNN API. Based on
available runtime hardware and constraints, this layer will choose different
implementations (cuDNN-based or pure-TensorFlow) to maximize the performance.
If a GPU is available and all the arguments to the layer meet the requirement
of the CuDNN kernel (see below for details), the layer will use a fast cuDNN
implementation. The requirements to use the cuDNN implementation are:

  1. `activation` == `tanh`
  2. `recurrent_activation` == `sigmoid`
  3. `recurrent_dropout` == 0
  4. `unroll` is `False`
  5. `use_bias` is `True`
  6. `reset_after` is `True`
  7. Inputs, if use masking, are strictly right-padded.
  8. Eager execution is enabled in the outermost context.

There are two variants of the GRU implementation. The default one is based on
v3 and has reset gate applied to hidden state before matrix multiplication.
The other one is based on original and has the order reversed. The second
variant is compatible with CuDNNGRU (GPU-only) and allows inference on CPU.
Thus it has separate biases for `kernel` and `recurrent_kernel`. To use this
variant, set `'reset_after'=True` and `recurrent_activation='sigmoid'`.

#### For example:

    
    inputs = tf.random.normal([32, 10, 8])
    gru = tf.keras.layers.GRU(4)
    output = gru(inputs)
    print(output.shape)
    (32, 4)
    gru = tf.keras.layers.GRU(4, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
    whole_sequence_output, final_state = gru(inputs)
    print(whole_sequence_output.shape)
    (32, 10, 4)
    print(final_state.shape)
    (32, 4)
    
| Arguments  
---  
`units` |  Positive integer, dimensionality of the output space.   
`activation` |  Activation function to use. Default: hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`). If you pass `None`, no activation is applied (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).   
`recurrent_activation` |  Activation function to use for the recurrent step. Default: sigmoid (`sigmoid`). If you pass `None`, no activation is applied (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).   
`use_bias` |  Boolean, (default `True`), whether the layer uses a bias vector.   
`kernel_initializer` |  Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix, used for the linear transformation of the inputs. Default: `glorot_uniform`.   
`recurrent_initializer` |  Initializer for the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix, used for the linear transformation of the recurrent state. Default: `orthogonal`.   
`bias_initializer` |  Initializer for the bias vector. Default: `zeros`.   
`kernel_regularizer` |  Regularizer function applied to the `kernel` weights matrix. Default: `None`.   
`recurrent_regularizer` |  Regularizer function applied to the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix. Default: `None`.   
`bias_regularizer` |  Regularizer function applied to the bias vector. Default: `None`.   
`activity_regularizer` |  Regularizer function applied to the output of the layer (its "activation"). Default: `None`.   
`kernel_constraint` |  Constraint function applied to the `kernel` weights matrix. Default: `None`.   
`recurrent_constraint` |  Constraint function applied to the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix. Default: `None`.   
`bias_constraint` |  Constraint function applied to the bias vector. Default: `None`.   
`dropout` |  Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the units to drop for the linear transformation of the inputs. Default: 0.   
`recurrent_dropout` |  Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the units to drop for the linear transformation of the recurrent state. Default: 0.   
`return_sequences` |  Boolean. Whether to return the last output in the output sequence, or the full sequence. Default: `False`.   
`return_state` |  Boolean. Whether to return the last state in addition to the output. Default: `False`.   
`go_backwards` |  Boolean (default `False`). If True, process the input sequence backwards and return the reversed sequence.   
`stateful` |  Boolean (default False). If True, the last state for each sample at index i in a batch will be used as initial state for the sample of index i in the following batch.   
`unroll` |  Boolean (default False). If True, the network will be unrolled, else a symbolic loop will be used. Unrolling can speed-up a RNN, although it tends to be more memory-intensive. Unrolling is only suitable for short sequences.   
`time_major` |  The shape format of the `inputs` and `outputs` tensors. If True, the inputs and outputs will be in shape `[timesteps, batch, feature]`, whereas in the False case, it will be `[batch, timesteps, feature]`. Using `time_major = True` is a bit more efficient because it avoids transposes at the beginning and end of the RNN calculation. However, most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by default this function accepts input and emits output in batch-major form.   
`reset_after` |  GRU convention (whether to apply reset gate after or before matrix multiplication). False = "before", True = "after" (default and CuDNN compatible).   
#### Call arguments:

  * `inputs`: A 3D tensor, with shape `[batch, timesteps, feature]`.
  * `mask`: Binary tensor of shape `[samples, timesteps]` indicating whether a given timestep should be masked (optional, defaults to `None`).
  * `training`: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in training mode or in inference mode. This argument is passed to the cell when calling it. This is only relevant if `dropout` or `recurrent_dropout` is used (optional, defaults to `None`).
  * `initial_state`: List of initial state tensors to be passed to the first call of the cell (optional, defaults to `None` which causes creation of zero-filled initial state tensors).

## Methods

### `get_dropout_mask_for_cell`

View source

    
    get_dropout_mask_for_cell(
        inputs, training, count=1
    )
    
Get the dropout mask for RNN cell's input.

It will create mask based on context if there isn't any existing cached mask.
If a new mask is generated, it will update the cache in the cell.

Args  
---  
`inputs` |  The input tensor whose shape will be used to generate dropout mask.   
`training` |  Boolean tensor, whether its in training mode, dropout will be ignored in non-training mode.   
`count` |  Int, how many dropout mask will be generated. It is useful for cell that has internal weights fused together.   
Returns  
---  
List of mask tensor, generated or cached mask based on context.  
### `get_recurrent_dropout_mask_for_cell`

View source

    
    get_recurrent_dropout_mask_for_cell(
        inputs, training, count=1
    )
    
Get the recurrent dropout mask for RNN cell.

It will create mask based on context if there isn't any existing cached mask.
If a new mask is generated, it will update the cache in the cell.

Args  
---  
`inputs` |  The input tensor whose shape will be used to generate dropout mask.   
`training` |  Boolean tensor, whether its in training mode, dropout will be ignored in non-training mode.   
`count` |  Int, how many dropout mask will be generated. It is useful for cell that has internal weights fused together.   
Returns  
---  
List of mask tensor, generated or cached mask based on context.  
### `reset_dropout_mask`

View source

    
    reset_dropout_mask()
    
Reset the cached dropout masks if any.

This is important for the RNN layer to invoke this in it `call()` method so
that the cached mask is cleared before calling the `cell.call()`. The mask
should be cached across the timestep within the same batch, but shouldn't be
cached between batches. Otherwise it will introduce unreasonable bias against
certain index of data within the batch.

### `reset_recurrent_dropout_mask`

View source

    
    reset_recurrent_dropout_mask()
    
Reset the cached recurrent dropout masks if any.

This is important for the RNN layer to invoke this in it call() method so that
the cached mask is cleared before calling the cell.call(). The mask should be
cached across the timestep within the same batch, but shouldn't be cached
between batches. Otherwise it will introduce unreasonable bias against certain
index of data within the batch.

### `reset_states`

View source

    
    reset_states(
        states=None
    )
    
Reset the recorded states for the stateful RNN layer.

Can only be used when RNN layer is constructed with `stateful` = `True`. Args:
states: Numpy arrays that contains the value for the initial state, which will
be feed to cell at the first time step. When the value is None, zero filled
numpy array will be created based on the cell state size.

Raises  
---  
`AttributeError` |  When the RNN layer is not stateful.   
`ValueError` |  When the batch size of the RNN layer is unknown.   
`ValueError` |  When the input numpy array is not compatible with the RNN layer state, either size wise or dtype wise.
