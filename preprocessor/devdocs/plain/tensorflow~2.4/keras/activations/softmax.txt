`tf.compat.v1.keras.activations.softmax`

    
    tf.keras.activations.softmax(
        x, axis=-1
    )
    
The elements of the output vector are in range (0, 1) and sum to 1. Each vector is handled independently. The `axis` argument sets which axis of the input the function is applied along. Softmax is often used as the activation for the last layer of a classification network because the result could be interpreted as a probability distribution. The softmax of each vector x is computed as `exp(x) / tf.reduce_sum(exp(x))`. The input values in are the log-odds of the resulting probability. | Arguments  
---  
`x` |  Input tensor.   
`axis` |  Integer, axis along which the softmax normalization is applied.   
Returns  
---  
Tensor, output of softmax transformation (all values are non-negative and sum
to 1).  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  In case `dim(x) == 1`.
