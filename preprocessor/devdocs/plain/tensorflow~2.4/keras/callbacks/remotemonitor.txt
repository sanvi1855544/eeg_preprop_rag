`tf.compat.v1.keras.callbacks.RemoteMonitor`

    
    tf.keras.callbacks.RemoteMonitor(
        root='http://localhost:9000', path='/publish/epoch/end/',
        field='data', headers=None, send_as_json=False
    )
    
Requires the `requests` library. Events are sent to `root + '/publish/epoch/end/'` by default. Calls are HTTP POST, with a `data` argument which is a JSON-encoded dictionary of event data. If `send_as_json=True`, the content type of the request will be `"application/json"`. Otherwise the serialized JSON will be sent within a form. | Arguments  
---  
`root` |  String; root url of the target server.   
`path` |  String; path relative to `root` to which the events will be sent.   
`field` |  String; JSON field under which the data will be stored. The field is used only if the payload is sent within a form (i.e. send_as_json is set to False).   
`headers` |  Dictionary; optional custom HTTP headers.   
`send_as_json` |  Boolean; whether the request should be sent as `"application/json"`.
