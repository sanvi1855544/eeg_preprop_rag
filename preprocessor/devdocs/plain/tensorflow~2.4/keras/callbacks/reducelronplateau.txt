`tf.compat.v1.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau`

    
    tf.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau(
        monitor='val_loss', factor=0.1, patience=10, verbose=0,
        mode='auto', min_delta=0.0001, cooldown=0, min_lr=0, **kwargs
    )
    
Models often benefit from reducing the learning rate by a factor of 2-10 once
learning stagnates. This callback monitors a quantity and if no improvement is
seen for a 'patience' number of epochs, the learning rate is reduced.

#### Example:

    
    reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', factor=0.2,
                                  patience=5, min_lr=0.001)
    model.fit(X_train, Y_train, callbacks=[reduce_lr])
    
| Arguments  
---  
`monitor` |  quantity to be monitored.   
`factor` |  factor by which the learning rate will be reduced. `new_lr = lr * factor`.   
`patience` |  number of epochs with no improvement after which learning rate will be reduced.   
`verbose` |  int. 0: quiet, 1: update messages.   
`mode` |  one of `{'auto', 'min', 'max'}`. In `'min'` mode, the learning rate will be reduced when the quantity monitored has stopped decreasing; in `'max'` mode it will be reduced when the quantity monitored has stopped increasing; in `'auto'` mode, the direction is automatically inferred from the name of the monitored quantity.   
`min_delta` |  threshold for measuring the new optimum, to only focus on significant changes.   
`cooldown` |  number of epochs to wait before resuming normal operation after lr has been reduced.   
`min_lr` |  lower bound on the learning rate.
