`tf.compat.v1.keras.regularizers.L1L2`

    
    tf.keras.regularizers.L1L2(
        l1=0.0, l2=0.0
    )
    
The L1 regularization penalty is computed as: `loss = l1 * reduce_sum(abs(x))`
The L2 regularization penalty is computed as `loss = l2 *
reduce_sum(square(x))` L1L2 may be passed to a layer as a string identifier:

    
    dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, kernel_regularizer='l1_l2')
    
In this case, the default values used are `l1=0.01` and `l2=0.01`. | Attributes  
---  
`l1` |  Float; L1 regularization factor.   
`l2` |  Float; L2 regularization factor.   
## Methods

### `from_config`

View source

    
    @classmethod
    from_config(
        config
    )
    
Creates a regularizer from its config.

This method is the reverse of `get_config`, capable of instantiating the same
regularizer from the config dictionary.

This method is used by Keras `model_to_estimator`, saving and loading models
to HDF5 formats, Keras model cloning, some visualization utilities, and
exporting models to and from JSON.

Arguments  
---  
`config` |  A Python dictionary, typically the output of get_config.   
Returns  
---  
A regularizer instance.  
### `get_config`

View source

    
    get_config()
    
Returns the config of the regularizer.

An regularizer config is a Python dictionary (serializable) containing all
configuration parameters of the regularizer. The same regularizer can be
reinstantiated later (without any saved state) from this configuration.

This method is optional if you are just training and executing models,
exporting to and from SavedModels, or using weight checkpoints.

This method is required for Keras `model_to_estimator`, saving and loading
models to HDF5 formats, Keras model cloning, some visualization utilities, and
exporting models to and from JSON.

Returns  
---  
Python dictionary.  
### `__call__`

View source

    
    __call__(
        x
    )
    
Compute a regularization penalty from an input tensor.
