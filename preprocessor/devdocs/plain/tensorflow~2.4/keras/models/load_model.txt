`tf.compat.v1.keras.models.load_model`

    
    tf.keras.models.load_model(
        filepath, custom_objects=None, compile=True, options=None
    )
    
#### Usage:

    
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, input_shape=(3,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Softmax()])
    model.save('/tmp/model')
    loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('/tmp/model')
    x = tf.random.uniform((10, 3))
    assert np.allclose(model.predict(x), loaded_model.predict(x))
    
Note that the model weights may have different scoped names after being loaded. Scoped names include the model/layer names, such as `"dense_1/kernel:0"`. It is recommended that you use the layer properties to access specific variables, e.g. `model.get_layer("dense_1").kernel`. | Arguments  
---  
`filepath` |  One of the following: 
  * String or `pathlib.Path` object, path to the saved model
  * `h5py.File` object from which to load the model 

  
`custom_objects` |  Optional dictionary mapping names (strings) to custom classes or functions to be considered during deserialization.   
`compile` |  Boolean, whether to compile the model after loading.   
`options` |  Optional `tf.saved_model.LoadOptions` object that specifies options for loading from SavedModel.   
Returns  
---  
A Keras model instance. If the original model was compiled, and saved with the
optimizer, then the returned model will be compiled. Otherwise, the model will
be left uncompiled. In the case that an uncompiled model is returned, a
warning is displayed if the `compile` argument is set to `True`.  
Raises  
---  
`ImportError` |  if loading from an hdf5 file and h5py is not available.   
`IOError` |  In case of an invalid savefile.
