#### Reference:

  * Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (CVPR 2015)

Optionally loads weights pre-trained on ImageNet. Note that the data format
convention used by the model is the one specified in your Keras config at
`~/.keras/keras.json`.

> Note: each Keras Application expects a specific kind of input preprocessing.
> For ResNet, call `tf.keras.applications.resnet.preprocess_input` on your
> inputs before passing them to the model.
| Arguments  
---  
`include_top` |  whether to include the fully-connected layer at the top of the network.   
`weights` |  one of `None` (random initialization), 'imagenet' (pre-training on ImageNet), or the path to the weights file to be loaded.   
`input_tensor` |  optional Keras tensor (i.e. output of `layers.Input()`) to use as image input for the model.   
`input_shape` |  optional shape tuple, only to be specified if `include_top` is False (otherwise the input shape has to be `(224, 224, 3)` (with `'channels_last'` data format) or `(3, 224, 224)` (with `'channels_first'` data format). It should have exactly 3 inputs channels, and width and height should be no smaller than 32. E.g. `(200, 200, 3)` would be one valid value.   
`pooling` |  Optional pooling mode for feature extraction when `include_top` is `False`. 
  * `None` means that the output of the model will be the 4D tensor output of the last convolutional block.
  * `avg` means that global average pooling will be applied to the output of the last convolutional block, and thus the output of the model will be a 2D tensor.
  * `max` means that global max pooling will be applied. 

  
`classes` |  optional number of classes to classify images into, only to be specified if `include_top` is True, and if no `weights` argument is specified.   
Returns
