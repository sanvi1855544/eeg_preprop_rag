    tf.nn.silu(
        features
    )
    
The SiLU activation function was introduced in "Gaussian Error Linear Units
(GELUs)" Hendrycks et al. 2016 and "Sigmoid-Weighted Linear Units for Neural
Network Function Approximation in Reinforcement Learning" Elfwing et al. 2017
and was independently discovered (and called swish) in "Searching for
Activation Functions" Ramachandran et al. 2017

Args  
---  
`features` |  A `Tensor` representing preactivation values.
