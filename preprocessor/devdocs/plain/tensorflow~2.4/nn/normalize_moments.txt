    tf.nn.normalize_moments(
        counts, mean_ss, variance_ss, shift, name=None
    )
    
| Args  
---  
`counts` |  A `Tensor` containing the total count of the data (one value).   
`mean_ss` |  A `Tensor` containing the mean sufficient statistics: the (possibly shifted) sum of the elements to average over.   
`variance_ss` |  A `Tensor` containing the variance sufficient statistics: the (possibly shifted) squared sum of the data to compute the variance over.   
`shift` |  A `Tensor` containing the value by which the data is shifted for numerical stability, or `None` if no shift was performed.   
`name` |  Name used to scope the operations that compute the moments.   
Returns  
---  
Two `Tensor` objects: `mean` and `variance`.
