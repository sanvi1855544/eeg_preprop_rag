# tf.nn.weighted_moments

View source on GitHub  Returns the frequency-weighted mean and variance of
`x`.

    
    tf.nn.weighted_moments(
        x, axes, frequency_weights, keepdims=False, name=None
    )
    
| Args  
---  
`x` |  A tensor.   
`axes` |  1-d tensor of int32 values; these are the axes along which to compute mean and variance.   
`frequency_weights` |  A tensor of positive weights which can be broadcast with x.   
`keepdims` |  Produce moments with the same dimensionality as the input.   
`name` |  Name used to scope the operation.   
Returns  
---  
Two tensors: `weighted_mean` and `weighted_variance`.
