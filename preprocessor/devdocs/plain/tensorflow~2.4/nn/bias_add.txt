`tf.compat.v1.nn.bias_add`

    
    tf.nn.bias_add(
        value, bias, data_format=None, name=None
    )
    
This is (mostly) a special case of `tf.add` where `bias` is restricted to 1-D. Broadcasting is supported, so `value` may have any number of dimensions. Unlike `tf.add`, the type of `bias` is allowed to differ from `value` in the case where both types are quantized. | Args  
---  
`value` |  A `Tensor` with type `float`, `double`, `int64`, `int32`, `uint8`, `int16`, `int8`, `complex64`, or `complex128`.   
`bias` |  A 1-D `Tensor` with size matching the channel dimension of `value`. Must be the same type as `value` unless `value` is a quantized type, in which case a different quantized type may be used.   
`data_format` |  A string. 'N...C' and 'NC...' are supported. If `None` (the default) is specified then 'N..C' is assumed.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` with the same type as `value`.  
Raises  
---  
ValueError if data format is unrecognized, if `value` has less than two
dimensions when `data_format` is 'N..C'/`None` or `value` has less then three
dimensions when `data_format` is `NC..`, if `bias` does not have exactly one
dimension (is a vector), or if the size of `bias` does not match the size of
the channel dimension of `value`.
