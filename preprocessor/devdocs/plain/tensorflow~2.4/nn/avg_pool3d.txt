    tf.nn.avg_pool3d(
        input, ksize, strides, padding, data_format='NDHWC', name=None
    )
    
Each entry in `output` is the mean of the corresponding size `ksize` window in `value`. | Args  
---  
`input` |  A 5-D `Tensor` of shape `[batch, height, width, channels]` and type `float32`, `float64`, `qint8`, `quint8`, or `qint32`.   
`ksize` |  An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `3` or `5`. The size of the window for each dimension of the input tensor.   
`strides` |  An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `3` or `5`. The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of the input tensor.   
`padding` |  A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm. See the "returns" section of `tf.nn.convolution` for details.   
`data_format` |  A string. 'NDHWC' and 'NCDHW' are supported.   
`name` |  Optional name for the operation.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` with the same type as `value`. The average pooled output tensor.
