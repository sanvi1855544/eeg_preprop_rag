# tf.nn.crelu

View source on GitHub  Computes Concatenated ReLU.

    
    tf.nn.crelu(
        features, axis=-1, name=None
    )
    
Concatenates a ReLU which selects only the positive part of the activation with a ReLU which selects only the negative part of the activation. Note that as a result this non-linearity doubles the depth of the activations. Source: Understanding and Improving Convolutional Neural Networks via Concatenated Rectified Linear Units. W.

---  
`features` |  A `Tensor` with type `float`, `double`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint8`, `int16`, or `int8`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
`axis` |  The axis that the output values are concatenated along. Default is -1.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` with the same type as `features`.
