# tf.nn.conv3d_transpose

View source on GitHub  The transpose of `conv3d`.

    
    tf.nn.conv3d_transpose(
        input, filters, output_shape, strides, padding='SAME',
        data_format='NDHWC', dilations=None, name=None
    )
    
This operation is sometimes called "deconvolution" after (Zeiler et al., 2010), but is really the transpose (gradient) of `conv3d` rather than an actual deconvolution. | Args  
---  
`input` |  A 5-D `Tensor` of type `float` and shape `[batch, depth, height, width, in_channels]` for `NDHWC` data format or `[batch, in_channels, depth, height, width]` for `NCDHW` data format.   
`filters` |  A 5-D `Tensor` with the same type as `input` and shape `[depth, height, width, output_channels, in_channels]`. `filter`'s `in_channels` dimension must match that of `input`.   
`output_shape` |  A 1-D `Tensor` representing the output shape of the deconvolution op.   
`strides` |  An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `3` or `5`. The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of `input`. If a single value is given it is replicated in the `D`, `H` and `W` dimension. By default the `N` and `C` dimensions are set to 0. The dimension order is determined by the value of `data_format`, see below for details.   
`padding` |  A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm. See the "returns" section of `tf.nn.convolution` for details.   
`data_format` |  A string. 'NDHWC' and 'NCDHW' are supported.   
`dilations` |  An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `3` or `5`, defaults to 1. The dilation factor for each dimension of`input`. If a single value is given it is replicated in the `D`, `H` and `W` dimension. By default the `N` and `C` dimensions are set to 1. If set to k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that dimension. The dimension order is determined by the value of `data_format`, see above for details. Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions if a 5-d tensor must be 1.   
`name` |  Optional name for the returned tensor.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` with the same type as `input`.
