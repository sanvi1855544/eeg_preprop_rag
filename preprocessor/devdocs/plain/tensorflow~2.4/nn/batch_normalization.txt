`tf.compat.v1.nn.batch_normalization`

    
    tf.nn.batch_normalization(
        x, mean, variance, offset, scale, variance_epsilon, name=None
    )
    
Normalizes a tensor by `mean` and `variance`, and applies (optionally) a
`scale` \\(\gamma\\) to it, as well as an `offset` \\(\beta\\):
\\(\frac{\gamma(x-\mu)}{\sigma}+\beta\\) `mean`, `variance`, `offset` and
`scale` are all expected to be of one of two shapes:

  * In all generality, they can have the same number of dimensions as the input `x`, with identical sizes as `x` for the dimensions that are not normalized over (the 'depth' dimension(s)), and dimension 1 for the others which are being normalized over. `mean` and `variance` in this case would typically be the outputs of `tf.nn.moments(..., keepdims=True)` during training, or running averages thereof during inference.
  * In the common case where the 'depth' dimension is the last dimension in the input tensor `x`, they may be one dimensional tensors of the same size as the 'depth' dimension. This is the case for example for the common `[batch, depth]` layout of fully-connected layers, and `[batch, height, width, depth]` for convolutions. `mean` and `variance` in this case would typically be the outputs of `tf.nn.moments(..., keepdims=False)` during training, or running averages thereof during inference.

See equation 11 in Algorithm 2 of source: Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift; S. Ioffe, C. Szegedy. | Args  
---  
`x` |  Input `Tensor` of arbitrary dimensionality.   
`mean` |  A mean `Tensor`.   
`variance` |  A variance `Tensor`.   
`offset` |  An offset `Tensor`, often denoted \\(\beta\\) in equations, or None. If present, will be added to the normalized tensor.   
`scale` |  A scale `Tensor`, often denoted \\(\gamma\\) in equations, or `None`. If present, the scale is applied to the normalized tensor.   
`variance_epsilon` |  A small float number to avoid dividing by 0.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
the normalized, scaled, offset tensor.
