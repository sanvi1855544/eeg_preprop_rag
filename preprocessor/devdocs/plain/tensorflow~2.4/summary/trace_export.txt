# tf.summary.trace_export

Stops and exports the active trace as a Summary and/or profile file.

    
    tf.summary.trace_export(
        name, step=None, profiler_outdir=None
    )
    
Stops the trace and exports all metadata collected during the trace to the
default SummaryWriter, if one has been set.

Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for the summary to be written.   
`step` |  Explicit `int64`-castable monotonic step value for this summary. If omitted, this defaults to `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`, which must not be None.   
`profiler_outdir` |  Output directory for profiler. This is only used when the profiler was enabled when the trace was started. In that case, if there is a logdir-based default SummaryWriter, this defaults to the same directory, but otherwise the argument must be passed.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if a default writer exists, but no step was provided and `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()` is None.
