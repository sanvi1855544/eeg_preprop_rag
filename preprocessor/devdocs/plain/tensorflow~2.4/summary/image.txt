# tf.summary.image

View source on GitHub  Write an image summary.

    
    tf.summary.image(
        name, data, step=None, max_outputs=3, description=None
    )
    
| Arguments  
---  
`name` |  A name for this summary. The summary tag used for TensorBoard will be this name prefixed by any active name scopes.   
`data` |  A `Tensor` representing pixel data with shape `[k, h, w, c]`, where `k` is the number of images, `h` and `w` are the height and width of the images, and `c` is the number of channels, which should be 1, 2, 3, or 4 (grayscale, grayscale with alpha, RGB, RGBA). Any of the dimensions may be statically unknown (i.e., `None`). Floating point data will be clipped to the range [0,1).   
`step` |  Explicit `int64`-castable monotonic step value for this summary. If omitted, this defaults to `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`, which must not be None.   
`max_outputs` |  Optional `int` or rank-0 integer `Tensor`. At most this many images will be emitted at each step. When more than `max_outputs` many images are provided, the first `max_outputs` many images will be used and the rest silently discarded.   
`description` |  Optional long-form description for this summary, as a constant `str`. Markdown is supported. Defaults to empty.   
Returns  
---  
True on success, or false if no summary was emitted because no default summary
writer was available.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if a default writer exists, but no step was provided and `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()` is None.
