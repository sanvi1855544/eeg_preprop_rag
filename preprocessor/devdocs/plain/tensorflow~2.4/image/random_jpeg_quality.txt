`tf.compat.v1.image.random_jpeg_quality`

    
    tf.image.random_jpeg_quality(
        image, min_jpeg_quality, max_jpeg_quality, seed=None
    )
    
`min_jpeg_quality` must be in the interval `[0, 100]` and less than
`max_jpeg_quality`. `max_jpeg_quality` must be in the interval `[0, 100]`.

#### Usage Example:

    
    x = [[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
          [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]],
        [[7.0, 8.0, 9.0],
          [10.0, 11.0, 12.0]]]
    tf.image.random_jpeg_quality(x, 75, 95)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 2, 3), dtype=float32, numpy=...>
    
| Args  
---  
`image` |  3D image. Size of the last dimension must be 1 or 3.   
`min_jpeg_quality` |  Minimum jpeg encoding quality to use.   
`max_jpeg_quality` |  Maximum jpeg encoding quality to use.   
`seed` |  An operation-specific seed. It will be used in conjunction with the graph-level seed to determine the real seeds that will be used in this operation. Please see the documentation of set_random_seed for its interaction with the graph-level random seed.   
Returns  
---  
Adjusted image(s), same shape and DType as `image`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if `min_jpeg_quality` or `max_jpeg_quality` is invalid.
