    tf.image.rgb_to_yuv(
        images
    )
    
Outputs a tensor of the same shape as the `images` tensor, containing the YUV value of the pixels. The output is only well defined if the value in images are in [0, 1]. There are two ways of representing an image: [0, 255] pixel values range or 0, 1 pixel values range. Users need to convert the input image into a float [0, 1] range. | Args  
---  
`images` |  2-D or higher rank. Image data to convert. Last dimension must be size 3.   
Returns  
---  
`images` |  tensor with the same shape as `images`.
