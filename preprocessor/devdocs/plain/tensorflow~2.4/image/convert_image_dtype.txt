    tf.image.convert_image_dtype(
        image, dtype, saturate=False, name=None
    )
    
Images that are represented using floating point values are expected to have
values in the range [0,1). Image data stored in integer data types are
expected to have values in the range `[0,MAX]`, where `MAX` is the largest
positive representable number for the data type. This op converts between data
types, scaling the values appropriately before casting. Note that converting
from floating point inputs to integer types may lead to over/underflow
problems. Set saturate to `True` to avoid such problem in problematic
conversions. If enabled, saturation will clip the output into the allowed
range before performing a potentially dangerous cast (and only before
performing such a cast, i.e., when casting from a floating point to an integer
type, and when casting from a signed to an unsigned type; `saturate` has no
effect on casts between floats, or on casts that increase the type's range).

#### Usage Example:

    
    x = [[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
          [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]],
        [[7.0, 8.0, 9.0],
          [10.0, 11.0, 12.0]]]
    tf.image.convert_image_dtype(x, dtype=tf.float16, saturate=False)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 2, 3), dtype=float16, numpy=
    array([[[ 1.,  2.,  3.],
            [ 4.,  5.,  6.]],
           [[ 7.,  8.,  9.],
            [10., 11., 12.]]], dtype=float16)>
    
| Args  
---  
`image` |  An image.   
`dtype` |  A `DType` to convert `image` to.   
`saturate` |  If `True`, clip the input before casting (if necessary).   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
`image`, converted to `dtype`.  
Raises  
---  
`AttributeError` |  Raises an attribute error when dtype is neither float nor integer
