    tf.image.per_image_standardization(
        image
    )
    
For each 3-D image `x` in `image`, computes `(x - mean) / adjusted_stddev`,
where

  * `mean` is the average of all values in `x`
  * `adjusted_stddev = max(stddev, 1.0/sqrt(N))` is capped away from 0 to protect against division by 0 when handling uniform images 
    * `N` is the number of elements in `x`
    * `stddev` is the standard deviation of all values in `x`

| Args  
---  
`image` |  An n-D Tensor with at least 3 dimensions, the last 3 of which are the dimensions of each image.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` with the same shape and dtype as `image`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if the shape of 'image' is incompatible with this function.
