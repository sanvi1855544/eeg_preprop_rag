# tf.image.stateless_random_crop

Randomly crops a tensor to a given size in a deterministic manner.

    
    tf.image.stateless_random_crop(
        value, size, seed, name=None
    )
    
Slices a shape `size` portion out of `value` at a uniformly chosen offset.
Requires `value.shape >= size`.

If a dimension should not be cropped, pass the full size of that dimension.
For example, RGB images can be cropped with `size = [crop_height, crop_width,
3]`.

Guarantees the same results given the same `seed` independent of how many
times the function is called, and independent of global seed settings (e.g.
`tf.random.set_seed`).

#### Usage Example:

    
    image = [[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]]
    seed = (1, 2)
    tf.image.stateless_random_crop(value=image, size=(1, 2, 3), seed=seed)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(1, 2, 3), dtype=int32, numpy=
    array([[[1, 2, 3],
            [4, 5, 6]]], dtype=int32)>
    
Args  
---  
`value` |  Input tensor to crop.   
`size` |  1-D tensor with size the rank of `value`.   
`seed` |  A shape [2] Tensor, the seed to the random number generator. Must have dtype `int32` or `int64`. (When using XLA, only `int32` is allowed.)   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A cropped tensor of the same rank as `value` and shape `size`.
