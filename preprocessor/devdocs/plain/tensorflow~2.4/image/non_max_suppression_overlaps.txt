`tf.compat.v1.image.non_max_suppression_overlaps`

    
    tf.image.non_max_suppression_overlaps(
        overlaps, scores, max_output_size, overlap_threshold=0.5,
        score_threshold=float('-inf'), name=None
    )
    
Prunes away boxes that have high overlap with previously selected boxes.
N-by-n overlap values are supplied as square matrix. The output of this
operation is a set of integers indexing into the input collection of bounding
boxes representing the selected boxes. The bounding box coordinates
corresponding to the selected indices can then be obtained using the
`tf.gather` operation. For example:

    
    selected_indices = tf.image.non_max_suppression_overlaps(
        overlaps, scores, max_output_size, iou_threshold)
    selected_boxes = tf.gather(boxes, selected_indices)
    
| Args  
---  
`overlaps` |  A 2-D float `Tensor` of shape `[num_boxes, num_boxes]`.   
`scores` |  A 1-D float `Tensor` of shape `[num_boxes]` representing a single score corresponding to each box (each row of boxes).   
`max_output_size` |  A scalar integer `Tensor` representing the maximum number of boxes to be selected by non-max suppression.   
`overlap_threshold` |  A float representing the threshold for deciding whether boxes overlap too much with respect to the provided overlap values.   
`score_threshold` |  A float representing the threshold for deciding when to remove boxes based on score.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
`selected_indices` |  A 1-D integer `Tensor` of shape `[M]` representing the selected indices from the overlaps tensor, where `M <= max_output_size`.
