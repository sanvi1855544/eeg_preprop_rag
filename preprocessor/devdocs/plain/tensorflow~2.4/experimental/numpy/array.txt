# tf.experimental.numpy.array

TensorFlow variant of NumPy's `array`.

    
    tf.experimental.numpy.array(
        val, dtype=None, copy=True, ndmin=0
    )
    
Since Tensors are immutable, a copy is made only if val is placed on a

different device than the current one. Even if `copy` is False, a new Tensor
may need to be built to satisfy `dtype` and `ndim`. This is used only if `val`
is an ndarray or a Tensor.

See the NumPy documentation for `numpy.array`.
