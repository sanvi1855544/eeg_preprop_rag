# tf.experimental.numpy.arange

TensorFlow variant of NumPy's `arange`.

    
    tf.experimental.numpy.arange(
        start, stop=None, step=1, dtype=None
    )
    
Returns `step`-separated values in the range [start, stop).

Args: start: Start of the interval. Included in the range. stop: End of the
interval. If not specified, `start` is treated as 0 and `start` value is used
as `stop`. If specified, it is not included in the range if `step` is integer.
When `step` is floating point, it may or may not be included. step: The
difference between 2 consecutive values in the output range. It is recommended
to use `linspace` instead of using non-integer values for `step`. dtype:
Optional. Type of the resulting ndarray. Could be a python type, a NumPy type
or a TensorFlow `DType`. If not provided, the largest type of `start`, `stop`,
`step` is used.

Raises: ValueError: If step is zero.

See the NumPy documentation for `numpy.arange`.
