# tf.experimental.dlpack.to_dlpack

Returns the dlpack capsule representing the tensor.

    
    tf.experimental.dlpack.to_dlpack(
        tf_tensor
    )
    
This operation ensures the underlying data memory is ready when returns.

    
    a = tf.tensor([1, 10])
    dlcapsule = tf.experimental.dlpack.to_dlpack(a)
    # dlcapsule represents the dlpack data structure
    
Args  
---  
`tf_tensor` |  Tensorflow eager tensor, to be converted to dlpack capsule.   
Returns  
---  
A PyCapsule named as dltensor, which shares the underlying memory to other
framework. This PyCapsule can be consumed only once.
