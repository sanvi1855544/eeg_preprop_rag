# tf.experimental.dlpack.from_dlpack

Returns the Tensorflow eager tensor.

    
    tf.experimental.dlpack.from_dlpack(
        dlcapsule
    )
    
The returned tensor uses the memory shared by dlpack capsules from other
framework.

    
    a = tf.experimental.dlpack.from_dlpack(dlcapsule)
    # `a` uses the memory shared by dlpack
    
Args  
---
