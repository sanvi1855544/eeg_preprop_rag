`tf.compat.v1.data.experimental.make_saveable_from_iterator`

    
    tf.data.experimental.make_saveable_from_iterator(
        iterator, external_state_policy='fail'
    )
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version. Instructions for updating: `make_saveable_from_iterator` is intended for use in TF1 with `tf.compat.v1.Saver`. In TF2, use `tf.train.Checkpoint` instead. | Args  
---  
`iterator` |  Iterator.   
`external_state_policy` |  A string that identifies how to handle input pipelines that depend on external state. Possible values are 'ignore': The external state is silently ignored. 'warn': The external state is ignored, logging a warning. 'fail': The operation fails upon encountering external state. By default we set it to 'fail'.   
Returns  
---  
A SaveableObject for saving/restoring iterator state using Saver.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If iterator does not support checkpointing.   
`ValueError` |  If `external_state_policy` is not one of 'warn', 'ignore' or 'fail'.   
#### For example:

    
    with tf.Graph().as_default():
      ds = tf.data.Dataset.range(10)
      iterator = ds.make_initializable_iterator()
      # Build the iterator SaveableObject.
      saveable_obj = tf.data.experimental.make_saveable_from_iterator(iterator)
      # Add the SaveableObject to the SAVEABLE_OBJECTS collection so
      # it can be automatically saved using Saver.
      tf.compat.v1.add_to_collection(tf.GraphKeys.SAVEABLE_OBJECTS, saveable_obj)
      saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver()
    
      while continue_training:
        ... Perform training ...
        if should_save_checkpoint:
          saver.save()
    
> Note: When restoring the iterator, the existing iterator state is completely
> discarded. This means that any changes you may have made to the Dataset
> graph will be discarded as well! This includes the new Dataset graph that
> you may have built during validation. So, while running validation, make
> sure to run the initializer for the validation input pipeline after
> restoring the checkpoint.
> Note: Not all iterators support checkpointing yet. Attempting to save the
> state of an unsupported iterator will throw an error.
