`tf.compat.v1.data.experimental.service.WorkerConfig`

    
    tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerConfig(
        dispatcher_address, worker_address=None, port=0, protocol='grpc',
        heartbeat_interval_ms=None, dispatcher_timeout_ms=None
    )
    
#### Fields:

  * `dispatcher_address`: Specifies the address of the dispatcher.
  * `worker_address`: Specifies the address of the worker server. This address is passed to the dispatcher so that the dispatcher can tell clients how to connect to this worker.
  * `port`: Specifies the port to bind to. A value of 0 indicates that the worker can bind to any available port.
  * `protocol`: (Optional.) Specifies the protocol to be used by the server. Defaults to `"grpc"`.
  * `heartbeat_interval_ms`: How often the worker should heartbeat to the dispatcher, in milliseconds. If not set, the runtime will select a reasonable default. A higher value will reduce the load on the dispatcher, while a lower value will reduce the time it takes to reclaim resources from finished jobs.
  * `dispatcher_timeout_ms`: How long, in milliseconds, to retry requests to the dispatcher before giving up and reporting an error. Defaults to 1 hour.
