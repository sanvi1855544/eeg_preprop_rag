    tf.data.experimental.group_by_window(
        key_func, reduce_func, window_size=None, window_size_func=None
    )
    
This transformation maps each consecutive element in a dataset to a key using `key_func` and groups the elements by key. It then applies `reduce_func` to at most `window_size_func(key)` elements matching the same key. All except the final window for each key will contain `window_size_func(key)` elements; the final window may be smaller. You may provide either a constant `window_size` or a window size determined by the key through `window_size_func`. | Args  
---  
`key_func` |  A function mapping a nested structure of tensors (having shapes and types defined by `self.output_shapes` and `self.output_types`) to a scalar `tf.int64` tensor.   
`reduce_func` |  A function mapping a key and a dataset of up to `window_size` consecutive elements matching that key to another dataset.   
`window_size` |  A `tf.int64` scalar `tf.Tensor`, representing the number of consecutive elements matching the same key to combine in a single batch, which will be passed to `reduce_func`. Mutually exclusive with `window_size_func`.   
`window_size_func` |  A function mapping a key to a `tf.int64` scalar `tf.Tensor`, representing the number of consecutive elements matching the same key to combine in a single batch, which will be passed to `reduce_func`. Mutually exclusive with `window_size`.   
Returns  
---  
A `Dataset` transformation function, which can be passed to
`tf.data.Dataset.apply`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if neither or both of {`window_size`, `window_size_func`} are passed.
