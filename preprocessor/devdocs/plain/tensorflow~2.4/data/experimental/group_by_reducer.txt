    tf.data.experimental.group_by_reducer(
        key_func, reducer
    )
    
This transformation maps element of a dataset to a key using `key_func` and groups the elements by key. The `reducer` is used to process each group; its `init_func` is used to initialize state for each group when it is created, the `reduce_func` is used to update the state every time an element is mapped to the matching group, and the `finalize_func` is used to map the final state to an output value. | Args  
---  
`key_func` |  A function mapping a nested structure of tensors (having shapes and types defined by `self.output_shapes` and `self.output_types`) to a scalar `tf.int64` tensor.   
`reducer` |  An instance of `Reducer`, which captures the reduction logic using the `init_func`, `reduce_func`, and `finalize_func` functions.   
Returns  
---  
A `Dataset` transformation function, which can be passed to
`tf.data.Dataset.apply`.
