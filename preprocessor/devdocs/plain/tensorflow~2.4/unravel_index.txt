`tf.compat.v1.unravel_index`

    
    tf.unravel_index(
        indices, dims, name=None
    )
    
#### Example:

    
    y = tf.unravel_index(indices=[2, 5, 7], dims=[3, 3])
    # 'dims' represent a hypothetical (3, 3) tensor of indices:
    # [[0, 1, *2*],
    #  [3, 4, *5*],
    #  [6, *7*, 8]]
    # For each entry from 'indices', this operation returns
    # its coordinates (marked with '*'), such as
    # 2 ==> (0, 2)
    # 5 ==> (1, 2)
    # 7 ==> (2, 1)
    y ==> [[0, 1, 2], [2, 2, 1]]
    
Args  
---  
`indices` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. An 0-D or 1-D `int` Tensor whose elements are indices into the flattened version of an array of dimensions dims.   
`dims` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `indices`. An 1-D `int` Tensor. The shape of the array to use for unraveling indices.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `indices`.
