`tf.compat.v1.compat.dimension_value`, `tf.compat.v1.dimension_value`

    
    tf.compat.dimension_value(
        dimension
    )
    
Until the release of TF 2.0, we need the legacy behavior of `TensorShape` to
coexist with the new behavior. This utility is a bridge between the two. When
accessing the value of a TensorShape dimension, use this utility, like this:

    
    # If you had this in your V1 code:
    value = tensor_shape[i].value
    
    # Use `dimension_value` as direct replacement compatible with both V1 & V2:
    value = dimension_value(tensor_shape[i])
    
    # This would be the V2 equivalent:
    value = tensor_shape[i]  # Warning: this will return the dim value in V2!
    
| Arguments  
---  
`dimension` |  Either a `Dimension` instance, an integer, or None.   
Returns  
---  
A plain value, i.e. an integer or None.
