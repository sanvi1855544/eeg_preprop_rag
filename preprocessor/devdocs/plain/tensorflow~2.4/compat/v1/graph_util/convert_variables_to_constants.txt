# tf.compat.v1.graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants

Replaces all the variables in a graph with constants of the same values.
(deprecated)

    
    tf.compat.v1.graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants(
        sess, input_graph_def, output_node_names, variable_names_whitelist=None,
        variable_names_blacklist=None
    )
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating: Use
`tf.compat.v1.graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants`

If you have a trained graph containing Variable ops, it can be convenient to
convert them all to Const ops holding the same values. This makes it possible
to describe the network fully with a single GraphDef file, and allows the
removal of a lot of ops related to loading and saving the variables.

Args  
---  
`sess` |  Active TensorFlow session containing the variables.   
`input_graph_def` |  GraphDef object holding the network.   
`output_node_names` |  List of name strings for the result nodes of the graph.   
`variable_names_whitelist` |  The set of variable names to convert (by default, all variables are converted).   
`variable_names_blacklist` |  The set of variable names to omit converting to constants.   
Returns  
---  
GraphDef containing a simplified version of the original.  
Raises  
---  
`RuntimeError` |  if a DT_RESOURCE op is found whose ancestor Variables are both denylisted AND whitelisted for freezing.
