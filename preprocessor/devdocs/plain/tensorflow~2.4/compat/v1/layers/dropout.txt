# tf.compat.v1.layers.Dropout

Applies Dropout to the input.

Inherits From: `Dropout`, `Layer`, `Layer`, `Module`

    
    tf.compat.v1.layers.Dropout(
        rate=0.5, noise_shape=None, seed=None, name=None, **kwargs
    )
    
Dropout consists in randomly setting a fraction `rate` of input units to 0 at
each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting. The units
that are kept are scaled by `1 / (1 - rate)`, so that their sum is unchanged
at training time and inference time.

Arguments  
---  
`rate` |  The dropout rate, between 0 and 1. E.g. `rate=0.1` would drop out 10% of input units.   
`noise_shape` |  1D tensor of type `int32` representing the shape of the binary dropout mask that will be multiplied with the input. For instance, if your inputs have shape `(batch_size, timesteps, features)`, and you want the dropout mask to be the same for all timesteps, you can use `noise_shape=[batch_size, 1, features]`.   
`seed` |  A Python integer. Used to create random seeds. See `tf.compat.v1.set_random_seed`. for behavior.   
`name` |  The name of the layer (string).   
Attributes

`graph` |
