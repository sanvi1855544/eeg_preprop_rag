# tf.compat.v1.train.cosine_decay

Applies cosine decay to the learning rate.

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.cosine_decay(
        learning_rate, global_step, decay_steps, alpha=0.0, name=None
    )
    
When training a model, it is often recommended to lower the learning rate as
the training progresses. This function applies a cosine decay function to a
provided initial learning rate. It requires a `global_step` value to compute
the decayed learning rate. You can just pass a TensorFlow variable that you
increment at each training step.

The function returns the decayed learning rate. It is computed as:

    
    global_step = min(global_step, decay_steps)
    cosine_decay = 0.5 * (1 + cos(pi * global_step / decay_steps))
    decayed = (1 - alpha) * cosine_decay + alpha
    decayed_learning_rate = learning_rate * decayed
    
#### Example usage:

    
    decay_steps = 1000
    lr_decayed = cosine_decay(learning_rate, global_step, decay_steps)
    
Args  
---  
`learning_rate` |  A scalar `float32` or `float64` Tensor or a Python number. The initial learning rate.   
`global_step` |  A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Global step to use for the decay computation.   
`decay_steps` |  A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Number of steps to decay over.   
`alpha` |  A scalar `float32` or `float64` Tensor or a Python number. Minimum learning rate value as a fraction of learning_rate.   
`name` |  String. Optional name of the operation. Defaults to 'CosineDecay'.   
Returns  
---  
A scalar `Tensor` of the same type as `learning_rate`. The decayed learning
rate.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if `global_step` is not supplied.

#### Eager Compatibility

When eager execution is enabled, this function returns a function which in
turn returns the decayed learning rate Tensor. This can be useful for changing
the learning rate value across different invocations of optimizer functions.
