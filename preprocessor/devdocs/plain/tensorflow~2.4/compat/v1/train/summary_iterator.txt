# tf.compat.v1.train.summary_iterator

Returns a iterator for reading `Event` protocol buffers from an event file.

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.summary_iterator(
        path
    )
    
You can use this function to read events written to an event file. It returns
a Python iterator that yields `Event` protocol buffers.

Example: Print the contents of an events file.

    
    for e in tf.compat.v1.train.summary_iterator(path to events file):
        print(e)
    
Example: Print selected summary values.

    
    # This example supposes that the events file contains summaries with a
    # summary value tag 'loss'.  These could have been added by calling
    # `add_summary()`, passing the output of a scalar summary op created with
    # with: `tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar('loss', loss_tensor)`.
    for e in tf.compat.v1.train.summary_iterator(path to events file):
        for v in e.summary.value:
            if v.tag == 'loss':
                print(v.simple_value)
    
Example: Continuously check for new summary values.

    
    summaries = tf.compat.v1.train.summary_iterator(path to events file)
    while True:
      for e in summaries:
          for v in e.summary.value:
              if v.tag == 'loss':
                  print(v.simple_value)
      # Wait for a bit before checking the file for any new events
      time.sleep(wait time)
    
See the protocol buffer definitions of Event and Summary for more information
about their attributes.
