`tf.compat.v1.train.queue_runner.start_queue_runners`

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.start_queue_runners(
        sess=None, coord=None, daemon=True, start=True,
        collection=tf.GraphKeys.QUEUE_RUNNERS
    )
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating: To construct input pipelines, use the `tf.data`
module.

This is a companion method to `add_queue_runner()`. It just starts threads for
all queue runners collected in the graph. It returns the list of all threads.

Args  
---  
`sess` |  `Session` used to run the queue ops. Defaults to the default session.   
`coord` |  Optional `Coordinator` for coordinating the started threads.   
`daemon` |  Whether the threads should be marked as `daemons`, meaning they don't block program exit.   
`start` |  Set to `False` to only create the threads, not start them.   
`collection` |  A `GraphKey` specifying the graph collection to get the queue runners from. Defaults to `GraphKeys.QUEUE_RUNNERS`.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if `sess` is None and there isn't any default session.   
`TypeError` |  if `sess` is not a `tf.compat.v1.Session` object.   
Returns  
---  
A list of threads.  
Raises  
---  
`RuntimeError` |  If called with eager execution enabled.   
`ValueError` |  If called without a default `tf.compat.v1.Session` registered.   
#### Eager Compatibility

Not compatible with eager execution. To ingest data under eager execution, use
the `tf.data` API instead.
