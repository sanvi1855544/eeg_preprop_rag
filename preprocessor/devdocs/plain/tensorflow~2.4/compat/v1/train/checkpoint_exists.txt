# tf.compat.v1.train.checkpoint_exists

Checks whether a V1 or V2 checkpoint exists with the specified prefix.
(deprecated)

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.checkpoint_exists(
        checkpoint_prefix
    )
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating: Use standard file APIs to check for files with this
prefix.

This is the recommended way to check if a checkpoint exists, since it takes
into account the naming difference between V1 and V2 formats.

Args  
---  
`checkpoint_prefix` |  the prefix of a V1 or V2 checkpoint, with V2 taking priority. Typically the result of `Saver.save()` or that of `tf.train.latest_checkpoint()`, regardless of sharded/non-sharded or V1/V2.   
Returns  
---  
A bool, true if a checkpoint referred to by `checkpoint_prefix` exists.
