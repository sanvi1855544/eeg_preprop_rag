# tf.compat.v1.train.update_checkpoint_state

Updates the content of the 'checkpoint' file. (deprecated)

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.update_checkpoint_state(
        save_dir, model_checkpoint_path, all_model_checkpoint_paths=None,
        latest_filename=None, all_model_checkpoint_timestamps=None,
        last_preserved_timestamp=None
    )
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating: Use `tf.train.CheckpointManager` to manage
checkpoints rather than manually editing the Checkpoint proto.

This updates the checkpoint file containing a CheckpointState proto.

Args  
---  
`save_dir` |  Directory where the model was saved.   
`model_checkpoint_path` |  The checkpoint file.   
`all_model_checkpoint_paths` |  List of strings. Paths to all not-yet-deleted checkpoints, sorted from oldest to newest. If this is a non-empty list, the last element must be equal to model_checkpoint_path. These paths are also saved in the CheckpointState proto.   
`latest_filename` |  Optional name of the checkpoint file. Default to 'checkpoint'.   
`all_model_checkpoint_timestamps` |  Optional list of timestamps (floats, seconds since the Epoch) indicating when the checkpoints in `all_model_checkpoint_paths` were created.   
`last_preserved_timestamp` |  A float, indicating the number of seconds since the Epoch when the last preserved checkpoint was written, e.g. due to a `keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours` parameter (see `tf.train.CheckpointManager` for an implementation).   
Raises  
---  
`RuntimeError` |  If any of the model checkpoint paths conflict with the file containing CheckpointSate.
