`tf.compat.v1.train.queue_runner.add_queue_runner`

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.add_queue_runner(
        qr, collection=tf.GraphKeys.QUEUE_RUNNERS
    )
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating: To construct input pipelines, use the `tf.data`
module.

When building a complex model that uses many queues it is often difficult to
gather all the queue runners that need to be run. This convenience function
allows you to add a queue runner to a well known collection in the graph.

The companion method `start_queue_runners()` can be used to start threads for
all the collected queue runners.

Args  
---  
`qr` |  A `QueueRunner`.   
`collection` |  A `GraphKey` specifying the graph collection to add the queue runner to. Defaults to `GraphKeys.QUEUE_RUNNERS`.
