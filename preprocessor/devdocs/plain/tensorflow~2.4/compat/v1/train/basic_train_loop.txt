# tf.compat.v1.train.basic_train_loop

Basic loop to train a model.

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.basic_train_loop(
        supervisor, train_step_fn, args=None, kwargs=None, master=''
    )
    
Calls `train_step_fn` in a loop to train a model. The function is called as:

    
    train_step_fn(session, *args, **kwargs)
    
It is passed a `tf.compat.v1.Session` in addition to `args` and `kwargs`. The
function typically runs one training step in the session.

Args  
---  
`supervisor` |  `tf.compat.v1.train.Supervisor` to run the training services.   
`train_step_fn` |  Callable to execute one training step. Called repeatedly as `train_step_fn(session, *args **kwargs)`.   
`args` |  Optional positional arguments passed to `train_step_fn`.   
`kwargs` |  Optional keyword arguments passed to `train_step_fn`.   
`master` |  Master to use to create the training session. Defaults to `""` which causes the session to be created in the local process.
