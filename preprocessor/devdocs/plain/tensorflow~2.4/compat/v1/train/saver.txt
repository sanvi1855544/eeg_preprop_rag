    )
    
See Variables for an overview of variables, saving and restoring.

The `Saver` class adds ops to save and restore variables to and from
checkpoints. It also provides convenience methods to run these ops.

Checkpoints are binary files in a proprietary format which map variable names
to tensor values. The best way to examine the contents of a checkpoint is to
load it using a `Saver`.

Savers can automatically number checkpoint filenames with a provided counter.
This lets you keep multiple checkpoints at different steps while training a
model. For example you can number the checkpoint filenames with the training
step number. To avoid filling up disks, savers manage checkpoint files
automatically. For example, they can keep only the N most recent files, or one
checkpoint for every N hours of training.

You number checkpoint filenames by passing a value to the optional
`global_step` argument to `save()`:

    
    saver.save(sess, 'my-model', global_step=0) ==> filename: 'my-model-0'
    ...
    saver.save(sess, 'my-model', global_step=1000) ==> filename: 'my-model-1000'
    
Additionally, optional arguments to the `Saver()` constructor let you control
the proliferation of checkpoint files on disk:

  * `max_to_keep` indicates the maximum number of recent checkpoint files to keep. As new files are created, older files are deleted. If None or 0, no checkpoints are deleted from the filesystem but only the last one is kept in the `checkpoint` file. Defaults to 5 (that is, the 5 most recent checkpoint files are kept.)
  * `keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours`: In addition to keeping the most recent `max_to_keep` checkpoint files, you might want to keep one checkpoint file for every N hours of training. This can be useful if you want to later analyze how a model progressed during a long training session. For example, passing `keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours=2` ensures that you keep one checkpoint file for every 2 hours of training. The default value of 10,000 hours effectively disables the feature.

Note that you still have to call the `save()` method to save the model.
Passing these arguments to the constructor will not save variables
automatically for you.

A training program that saves regularly looks like:

    
    ...
    # Create a saver.
    saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver(...variables...)
    # Launch the graph and train, saving the model every 1,000 steps.
    sess = tf.compat.v1.Session()
    for step in xrange(1000000):
        sess.run(..training_op..)
        if step % 1000 == 0:
            # Append the step number to the checkpoint name:
            saver.save(sess, 'my-model', global_step=step)
    
In addition to checkpoint files, savers keep a protocol buffer on disk with
the list of recent checkpoints. This is used to manage numbered checkpoint
files and by `latest_checkpoint()`, which makes it easy to discover the path
to the most recent checkpoint. That protocol buffer is stored in a file named
'checkpoint' next to the checkpoint files.

If you create several savers, you can specify a different filename for the
protocol buffer file in the call to `save()`.

Args  
---  
`var_list` |  A list of `Variable`/`SaveableObject`, or a dictionary mapping names to `SaveableObject`s. If `None`, defaults to the list of all saveable objects.   
`reshape` |  If `True`, allows restoring parameters from a checkpoint where the variables have a different shape.   
`sharded` |  If `True`, shard the checkpoints, one per device.   
`max_to_keep` |  Maximum number of recent checkpoints to keep. Defaults to 5.   
`keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours` |  How often to keep checkpoints. Defaults to 10,000 hours.   
`name` |  String. Optional name to use as a prefix when adding operations.   
`restore_sequentially` |  A `Bool`, which if true, causes restore of different variables to happen sequentially within each device. This can lower memory usage when restoring very large models.   
`saver_def` |  Optional `SaverDef` proto to use instead of running the builder. This is only useful for specialty code that wants to recreate a `Saver` object for a previously built `Graph` that had a `Saver`. The `saver_def` proto should be the one returned by the `as_saver_def()` call of the `Saver` that was created for that `Graph`.   
`builder` |  Optional `SaverBuilder` to use if a `saver_def` was not provided. Defaults to `BulkSaverBuilder()`.   
`defer_build` |  If `True`, defer adding the save and restore ops to the `build()` call. In that case `build()` should be called before finalizing the graph or using the saver.   
`allow_empty` |  If `False` (default) raise an error if there are no variables in the graph. Otherwise, construct the saver anyway and make it a no-op.   
`write_version` |  controls what format to use when saving checkpoints. It also affects certain filepath matching logic. The V2 format is the recommended choice: it is much more optimized than V1 in terms of memory required and latency incurred during restore. Regardless of this flag, the Saver is able to restore from both V2 and V1 checkpoints.   
`pad_step_number` |  if True, pads the global step number in the checkpoint filepaths to some fixed width (8 by default). This is turned off by default.   
`save_relative_paths` |  If `True`, will write relative paths to the checkpoint state file. This is needed if the user wants to copy the checkpoint directory and reload from the copied directory.   
`filename` |  If known at graph construction time, filename used for variable loading/saving.   
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `var_list` is invalid.   
`ValueError` |  If any of the keys or values in `var_list` are not unique.   
`RuntimeError` |  If eager execution is enabled and`var_list` does not specify a list of variables to save.   
Attributes  
---  
`last_checkpoints` |  List of not-yet-deleted checkpoint filenames. You can pass any of the returned values to `restore()`.

### `recover_last_checkpoints`

View source

    
    recover_last_checkpoints(
        checkpoint_paths
    )
    
Recovers the internal saver state after a crash.

This method is useful for recovering the "self._last_checkpoints" state.

Globs for the checkpoints pointed to by `checkpoint_paths`. If the files
exist, use their mtime as the checkpoint timestamp.

Args  
---  
`checkpoint_paths` |  a list of checkpoint paths.   
### `restore`

View source

    
    restore(
        sess, save_path
    )
    
Restores previously saved variables.

This method runs the ops added by the constructor for restoring variables. It
requires a session in which the graph was launched. The variables to restore
do not have to have been initialized, as restoring is itself a way to
initialize variables.

The `save_path` argument is typically a value previously returned from a
`save()` call, or a call to `latest_checkpoint()`.

Args  
---  
`sess` |  A `Session` to use to restore the parameters. None in eager mode.   
`save_path` |  Path where parameters were previously saved.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If save_path is None or not a valid checkpoint.   
### `save`

View source

    
    save(
        sess, save_path, global_step=None, latest_filename=None,
        meta_graph_suffix='meta', write_meta_graph=True, write_state=True,
        strip_default_attrs=False, save_debug_info=False
    )
    
Saves variables.

This method runs the ops added by the constructor for saving variables. It
requires a session in which the graph was launched. The variables to save must
also have been initialized.

The method returns the path prefix of the newly created checkpoint files. This
string can be passed directly to a call to `restore()`.

Args  
---  
`sess` |  A Session to use to save the variables.   
`save_path` |  String. Prefix of filenames created for the checkpoint.   
`global_step` |  If provided the global step number is appended to `save_path` to create the checkpoint filenames. The optional argument can be a `Tensor`, a `Tensor` name or an integer.   
`latest_filename` |  Optional name for the protocol buffer file that will contains the list of most recent checkpoints. That file, kept in the same directory as the checkpoint files, is automatically managed by the saver to keep track of recent checkpoints. Defaults to 'checkpoint'.   
`meta_graph_suffix` |  Suffix for `MetaGraphDef` file. Defaults to 'meta'.   
`write_meta_graph` |  `Boolean` indicating whether or not to write the meta graph file.   
`write_state` |  `Boolean` indicating whether or not to write the `CheckpointStateProto`.   
`strip_default_attrs` |  Boolean. If `True`, default-valued attributes will be removed from the NodeDefs. For a detailed guide, see Stripping Default-Valued Attributes.   
`save_debug_info` |  If `True`, save the GraphDebugInfo to a separate file, which in the same directory of save_path and with `_debug` added before the file extension. This is only enabled when `write_meta_graph` is `True`  
Returns  
---  
A string: path prefix used for the checkpoint files. If the saver is sharded,
this string ends with: '-?????-of-nnnnn' where 'nnnnn' is the number of shards
created. If the saver is empty, returns None.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `sess` is not a `Session`.   
`ValueError` |  If `latest_filename` contains path components, or if it collides with `save_path`.   
`RuntimeError` |  If save and restore ops weren't built.   
### `set_last_checkpoints`

View source

    
    set_last_checkpoints(
        last_checkpoints
    )
    
DEPRECATED: Use set_last_checkpoints_with_time.

Sets the list of old checkpoint filenames.

Args  
---  
`last_checkpoints` |  A list of checkpoint filenames.   
Raises  
---  
`AssertionError` |  If last_checkpoints is not a list.   
### `set_last_checkpoints_with_time`
