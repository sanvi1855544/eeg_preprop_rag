`tf.compat.v1.random.get_seed`

    
    tf.compat.v1.get_seed(
        op_seed
    )
    
Given operation-specific seed, `op_seed`, this helper function returns two
seeds derived from graph-level and op-level seeds. Many random operations
internally use the two seeds to allow user to change the seed globally for a
graph, or for only specific operations.

For details on how the graph-level seed interacts with op seeds, see
`tf.compat.v1.random.set_random_seed`.

Args  
---  
`op_seed` |  integer.   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of two integers that should be used for the local seed of this
operation.
