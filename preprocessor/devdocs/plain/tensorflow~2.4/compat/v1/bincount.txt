`tf.compat.v1.math.bincount`

    
    tf.compat.v1.bincount(
        arr, weights=None, minlength=None, maxlength=None, dtype=tf.dtypes.int32
    )
    
If `minlength` and `maxlength` are not given, returns a vector with length
`tf.reduce_max(arr) + 1` if `arr` is non-empty, and length 0 otherwise. If
`weights` are non-None, then index `i` of the output stores the sum of the
value in `weights` at each index where the corresponding value in `arr` is
`i`.

Args  
---  
`arr` |  An int32 tensor of non-negative values.   
`weights` |  If non-None, must be the same shape as arr. For each value in `arr`, the bin will be incremented by the corresponding weight instead of 1.   
`minlength` |  If given, ensures the output has length at least `minlength`, padding with zeros at the end if necessary.   
`maxlength` |  If given, skips values in `arr` that are equal or greater than `maxlength`, ensuring that the output has length at most `maxlength`.   
`dtype` |  If `weights` is None, determines the type of the output bins.   
Returns  
---  
A vector with the same dtype as `weights` or the given `dtype`. The bin
values.
