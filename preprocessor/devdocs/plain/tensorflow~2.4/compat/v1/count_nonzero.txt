`tf.compat.v1.math.count_nonzero`

    
    tf.compat.v1.count_nonzero(
        input_tensor=None, axis=None, keepdims=None, dtype=tf.dtypes.int64, name=None,
        reduction_indices=None, keep_dims=None, input=None
    )
    
Warning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(keep_dims)`. They will be removed in
a future version. Instructions for updating: keep_dims is deprecated, use
keepdims insteadWarning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(reduction_indices)`.
They will be removed in a future version. Instructions for updating:
reduction_indices is deprecated, use axis instead

Reduces `input_tensor` along the dimensions given in `axis`. Unless `keepdims`
is true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each entry in `axis`. If
`keepdims` is true, the reduced dimensions are retained with length 1.

If `axis` has no entries, all dimensions are reduced, and a tensor with a
single element is returned.

#### For example:

    
    x = tf.constant([[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]])
    tf.math.count_nonzero(x)  # 3
    tf.math.count_nonzero(x, 0)  # [1, 2, 0]
    tf.math.count_nonzero(x, 1)  # [1, 2]
    tf.math.count_nonzero(x, 1, keepdims=True)  # [[1], [2]]
    tf.math.count_nonzero(x, [0, 1])  # 3
    
> Note: Strings are compared against zero-length empty string `""`. Any string
> with a size greater than zero is already considered as nonzero.
#### For example:

    
    x = tf.constant(["", "a", "  ", "b", ""])
    tf.math.count_nonzero(x) # 3, with "a", "  ", and "b" as nonzero strings.
    
Args  
---  
`input_tensor` |  The tensor to reduce. Should be of numeric type, `bool`, or `string`.   
`axis` |  The dimensions to reduce. If `None` (the default), reduces all dimensions. Must be in the range `[-rank(input_tensor), rank(input_tensor))`.   
`keepdims` |  If true, retains reduced dimensions with length 1.   
`dtype` |  The output dtype; defaults to `tf.int64`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
`reduction_indices` |  The old (deprecated) name for axis.   
`keep_dims` |  Deprecated alias for `keepdims`.   
`input` |  Overrides input_tensor. For compatibility.   
Returns  
---  
The reduced tensor (number of nonzero values).
