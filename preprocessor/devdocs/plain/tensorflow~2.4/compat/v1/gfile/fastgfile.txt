# tf.compat.v1.gfile.FastGFile

File I/O wrappers without thread locking.

    
    tf.compat.v1.gfile.FastGFile(
        name, mode='r'
    )
    
Note, that this is somewhat like builtin Python file I/O, but there are
semantic differences to make it more efficient for some backing filesystems.
For example, a write mode file will not be opened until the first write call
(to minimize RPC invocations in network filesystems).

Attributes  
---  
`mode` |  Returns the mode in which the file was opened.   
`name` |  Returns the file name.   
## Methods

### `close`

View source

    
    close()
    
Closes FileIO. Should be called for the WritableFile to be flushed.

### `flush`

View source

    
    flush()
    
Flushes the Writable file.

This only ensures that the data has made its way out of the process without
any guarantees on whether it's written to disk. This means that the data would
survive an application crash but not necessarily an OS crash.

### `next`

View source

    
    next()
    
### `read`

View source

    
    read(
        n=-1
    )
    
Returns the contents of a file as a string.

Starts reading from current position in file.

Args  
---  
`n` |  Read `n` bytes if `n != -1`. If `n = -1`, reads to end of file.   
Returns  
---  
`n` bytes of the file (or whole file) in bytes mode or `n` bytes of the string
if in string (regular) mode.  
### `readline`

View source

    
    readline()
    
Reads the next line, keeping \n. At EOF, returns ''.

### `readlines`

View source

    
    readlines()
    
Returns all lines from the file in a list.

### `seek`

View source

    
    seek(
        offset=None, whence=0, position=None
    )
    
Seeks to the offset in the file. (deprecated arguments)

Warning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(position)`. They will be removed in
a future version. Instructions for updating: position is deprecated in favor
of the offset argument. Args  
---  
`offset` |  The byte count relative to the whence argument.   
`whence` |  Valid values for whence are: 0: start of the file (default) 1: relative to the current position of the file 2: relative to the end of file. `offset` is usually negative.   
### `seekable`

View source

    
    seekable()
    
Returns True as FileIO supports random access ops of seek()/tell()

### `size`

View source

    
    size()
    
Returns the size of the file.

### `tell`

View source

    
    tell()
    
Returns the current position in the file.

### `write`

View source

    
    write(
        file_content
    )
    
Writes file_content to the file. Appends to the end of the file.

### `__enter__`

View source

    
    __enter__()
    
Make usable with "with" statement.

### `__exit__`

View source

    
    __exit__(
        unused_type, unused_value, unused_traceback
    )
    
Make usable with "with" statement.

### `__iter__`

View source

    
    __iter__()
