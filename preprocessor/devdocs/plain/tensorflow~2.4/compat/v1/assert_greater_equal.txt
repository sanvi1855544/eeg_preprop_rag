`tf.compat.v1.debugging.assert_greater_equal`

    
    tf.compat.v1.assert_greater_equal(
        x, y, data=None, summarize=None, message=None, name=None
    )
    
This condition holds if for every pair of (possibly broadcast) elements
`x[i]`, `y[i]`, we have `x[i] >= y[i]`. If both `x` and `y` are empty, this is
trivially satisfied.

When running in graph mode, you should add a dependency on this operation to
ensure that it runs. Example of adding a dependency to an operation:

    
    with tf.control_dependencies([tf.compat.v1.assert_greater_equal(x, y)]):
      output = tf.reduce_sum(x)
    
Args  
---  
`x` |  Numeric `Tensor`.   
`y` |  Numeric `Tensor`, same dtype as and broadcastable to `x`.   
`data` |  The tensors to print out if the condition is False. Defaults to error message and first few entries of `x`, `y`.   
`summarize` |  Print this many entries of each tensor.   
`message` |  A string to prefix to the default message.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional). Defaults to "assert_greater_equal".   
Returns  
---  
Op that raises `InvalidArgumentError` if `x >= y` is False.  
Raises  
---  
`InvalidArgumentError` |  if the check can be performed immediately and `x >= y` is False. The check can be performed immediately during eager execution or if `x` and `y` are statically known.
