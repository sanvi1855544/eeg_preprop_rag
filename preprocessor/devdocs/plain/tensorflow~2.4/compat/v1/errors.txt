# Module: tf.compat.v1.errors

Exception types for TensorFlow errors.

## Classes

`class AbortedError`: The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrent
action.

`class AlreadyExistsError`: Raised when an entity that we attempted to create
already exists.

`class CancelledError`: Raised when an operation or step is cancelled.

`class DataLossError`: Raised when unrecoverable data loss or corruption is
encountered.

`class DeadlineExceededError`: Raised when a deadline expires before an
operation could complete.

`class FailedPreconditionError`: Operation was rejected because the system is
not in a state to execute it.

`class InternalError`: Raised when the system experiences an internal error.

`class InvalidArgumentError`: Raised when an operation receives an invalid
argument.

`class NotFoundError`: Raised when a requested entity (e.g., a file or
directory) was not found.

`class OpError`: A generic error that is raised when TensorFlow execution
fails.

`class OutOfRangeError`: Raised when an operation iterates past the valid
input range.

`class PermissionDeniedError`: Raised when the caller does not have permission
to run an operation.

`class ResourceExhaustedError`: Some resource has been exhausted.

`class UnauthenticatedError`: The request does not have valid authentication
credentials.

`class UnavailableError`: Raised when the runtime is currently unavailable.

`class UnimplementedError`: Raised when an operation has not been implemented.

`class UnknownError`: Unknown error.

`class raise_exception_on_not_ok_status`: Context manager to check for C API
status.
