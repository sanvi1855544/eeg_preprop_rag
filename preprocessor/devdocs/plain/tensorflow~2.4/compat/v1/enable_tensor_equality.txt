# tf.compat.v1.enable_tensor_equality

Compare Tensors with element-wise comparison and thus be unhashable.

    
    tf.compat.v1.enable_tensor_equality()
    
Comparing tensors with element-wise allows comparisons such as
tf.Variable(1.0) == 1.0. Element-wise equality implies that tensors are
unhashable. Thus tensors can no longer be directly used in sets or as a key in
a dictionary.
