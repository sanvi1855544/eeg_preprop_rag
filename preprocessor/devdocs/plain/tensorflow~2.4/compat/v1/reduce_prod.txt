`tf.compat.v1.math.reduce_prod`

    
    tf.compat.v1.reduce_prod(
        input_tensor, axis=None, keepdims=None, name=None, reduction_indices=None,
        keep_dims=None
    )
    
Warning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(keep_dims)`. They will be removed in
a future version. Instructions for updating: keep_dims is deprecated, use
keepdims instead

Reduces `input_tensor` along the dimensions given in `axis`. Unless `keepdims`
is true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each of the entries in
`axis`, which must be unique. If `keepdims` is true, the reduced dimensions
are retained with length 1.

If `axis` is None, all dimensions are reduced, and a tensor with a single
element is returned.

Args  
---  
`input_tensor` |  The tensor to reduce. Should have numeric type.   
`axis` |  The dimensions to reduce. If `None` (the default), reduces all dimensions. Must be in the range `[-rank(input_tensor), rank(input_tensor))`.   
`keepdims` |  If true, retains reduced dimensions with length 1.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
`reduction_indices` |  The old (deprecated) name for axis.   
`keep_dims` |  Deprecated alias for `keepdims`.   
Returns  
---  
The reduced tensor.
