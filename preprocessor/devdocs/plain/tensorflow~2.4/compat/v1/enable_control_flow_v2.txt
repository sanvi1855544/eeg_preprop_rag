# tf.compat.v1.enable_control_flow_v2

Use control flow v2.

    
    tf.compat.v1.enable_control_flow_v2()
    
control flow v2 (cfv2) is an improved version of control flow in TensorFlow
with support for higher order derivatives. Enabling cfv2 will change the
graph/function representation of control flow, e.g., `tf.while_loop` and
`tf.cond` will generate functional `While` and `If` ops instead of low-level
`Switch`, `Merge` etc. ops. Note: Importing and running graphs exported with
old control flow will still be supported.

Calling tf.enable_control_flow_v2() lets you opt-in to this TensorFlow 2.0
feature.

> Note: v2 control flow is always enabled inside of tf.function. Calling this
> function is not required.
