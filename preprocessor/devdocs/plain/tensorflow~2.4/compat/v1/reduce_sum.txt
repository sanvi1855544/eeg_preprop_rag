`tf.compat.v1.math.reduce_sum`

    
    tf.compat.v1.reduce_sum(
        input_tensor, axis=None, keepdims=None, name=None, reduction_indices=None,
        keep_dims=None
    )
    
Warning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(keep_dims)`. They will be removed in
a future version. Instructions for updating: keep_dims is deprecated, use
keepdims instead

Reduces `input_tensor` along the dimensions given in `axis`. Unless `keepdims`
is true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each of the entries in
`axis`, which must be unique. If `keepdims` is true, the reduced dimensions
are retained with length 1.

If `axis` is None, all dimensions are reduced, and a tensor with a single
element is returned.

#### For example:

    
    x = tf.constant([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]])
    tf.reduce_sum(x)  # 6
    tf.reduce_sum(x, 0)  # [2, 2, 2]
    tf.reduce_sum(x, 1)  # [3, 3]
    tf.reduce_sum(x, 1, keepdims=True)  # [[3], [3]]
    tf.reduce_sum(x, [0, 1])  # 6
    
Args  
---  
`input_tensor` |  The tensor to reduce. Should have numeric type.   
`axis` |  The dimensions to reduce. If `None` (the default), reduces all dimensions. Must be in the range `[-rank(input_tensor), rank(input_tensor))`.   
`keepdims` |  If true, retains reduced dimensions with length 1.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
`reduction_indices` |  The old (deprecated) name for axis.   
`keep_dims` |  Deprecated alias for `keepdims`.   
Returns  
---  
The reduced tensor, of the same dtype as the input_tensor.  
#### Numpy Compatibility

Equivalent to np.sum apart the fact that numpy upcast uint8 and int32 to int64
while tensorflow returns the same dtype as the input.
