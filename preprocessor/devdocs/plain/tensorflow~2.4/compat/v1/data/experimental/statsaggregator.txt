# tf.compat.v1.data.experimental.StatsAggregator

A stateful resource that aggregates statistics from one or more iterators.

    
    tf.compat.v1.data.experimental.StatsAggregator()
    
To record statistics, use one of the custom transformation functions defined
in this module when defining your `tf.data.Dataset`. All statistics will be
aggregated by the `StatsAggregator` that is associated with a particular
iterator (see below). For example, to record the latency of producing each
element by iterating over a dataset:

    
    dataset = ...
    dataset = dataset.apply(tf.data.experimental.latency_stats("total_bytes"))
    
To associate a `StatsAggregator` with a `tf.data.Dataset` object, use the
following pattern:

    
    aggregator = tf.data.experimental.StatsAggregator()
    dataset = ...
    
    # Apply `StatsOptions` to associate `dataset` with `aggregator`.
    options = tf.data.Options()
    options.experimental_stats.aggregator = aggregator
    dataset = dataset.with_options(options)
    
To get a protocol buffer summary of the currently aggregated statistics, use
the `StatsAggregator.get_summary()` tensor. The easiest way to do this is to
add the returned tensor to the `tf.GraphKeys.SUMMARIES` collection, so that
the summaries will be included with any existing summaries.

    
    aggregator = tf.data.experimental.StatsAggregator()
    # ...
    stats_summary = aggregator.get_summary()
    tf.compat.v1.add_to_collection(tf.GraphKeys.SUMMARIES, stats_summary)
    
> Note: This interface is experimental and expected to change. In particular,
> we expect to add other implementations of `StatsAggregator` that provide
> different ways of exporting statistics, and add more types of statistics.
## Methods

### `get_summary`

View source

    
    get_summary()
    
Returns a string `tf.Tensor` that summarizes the aggregated statistics.

The returned tensor will contain a serialized `tf.compat.v1.summary.Summary`
protocol buffer, which can be used with the standard TensorBoard logging
facilities.

Returns  
---  
A scalar string `tf.Tensor` that summarizes the aggregated statistics.
