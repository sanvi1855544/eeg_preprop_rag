# tf.compat.v1.summary.merge

Merges summaries.

    
    tf.compat.v1.summary.merge(
        inputs, collections=None, name=None
    )
    
This op creates a `Summary` protocol buffer that contains the union of all the
values in the input summaries.

When the Op is run, it reports an `InvalidArgument` error if multiple values
in the summaries to merge use the same tag.

Args  
---  
`inputs` |  A list of `string` `Tensor` objects containing serialized `Summary` protocol buffers.   
`collections` |  Optional list of graph collections keys. The new summary op is added to these collections. Defaults to `[]`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A scalar `Tensor` of type `string`. The serialized `Summary` protocol buffer
resulting from the merging.  
Raises  
---  
`RuntimeError` |  If called with eager mode enabled.   
#### Eager Compatibility

Not compatible with eager execution. To write TensorBoard summaries under
eager execution, use `tf.contrib.summary` instead.
