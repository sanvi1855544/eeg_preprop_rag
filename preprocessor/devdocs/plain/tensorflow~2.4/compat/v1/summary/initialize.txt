# tf.compat.v1.summary.initialize

Initializes summary writing for graph execution mode.

    
    tf.compat.v1.summary.initialize(
        graph=None, session=None
    )
    
This operation is a no-op when executing eagerly.

This helper method provides a higher-level alternative to using
`tf.contrib.summary.summary_writer_initializer_op` and
`tf.contrib.summary.graph`.

Most users will also want to call `tf.compat.v1.train.create_global_step`
which can happen before or after this function is called.

Args  
---  
`graph` |  A `tf.Graph` or `tf.compat.v1.GraphDef` to output to the writer. This function will not write the default graph by default. When writing to an event log file, the associated step will be zero.   
`session` |  So this method can call `tf.Session.run`. This defaults to `tf.compat.v1.get_default_session`.   
Raises  
---  
`RuntimeError` |  If the current thread has no default `tf.contrib.summary.SummaryWriter`.   
`ValueError` |  If session wasn't passed and no default session.
