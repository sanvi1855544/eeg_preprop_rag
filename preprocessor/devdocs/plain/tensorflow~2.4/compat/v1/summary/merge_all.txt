# tf.compat.v1.summary.merge_all

Merges all summaries collected in the default graph.

    
    tf.compat.v1.summary.merge_all(
        key=tf.GraphKeys.SUMMARIES, scope=None, name=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`key` |  `GraphKey` used to collect the summaries. Defaults to `GraphKeys.SUMMARIES`.   
`scope` |  Optional scope used to filter the summary ops, using `re.match`  
Returns  
---  
If no summaries were collected, returns None. Otherwise returns a scalar
`Tensor` of type `string` containing the serialized `Summary` protocol buffer
resulting from the merging.  
Raises  
---  
`RuntimeError` |  If called with eager execution enabled.   
#### Eager Compatibility

Not compatible with eager execution. To write TensorBoard summaries under
eager execution, use `tf.contrib.summary` instead.
