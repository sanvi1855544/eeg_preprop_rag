# Module: tf.compat.v1.autograph

Conversion of plain Python into TensorFlow graph code.

> Note: In TensorFlow 2.0, AutoGraph is automatically applied when using
> `tf.function`. This module contains lower-level APIs for advanced use.
For more information, see the AutoGraph guide.

By equivalent graph code we mean code that generates a TensorFlow graph when
run. The generated graph has the same effects as the original code when
executed (for example with `tf.function` or `tf.compat.v1.Session.run`). In
other words, using AutoGraph can be thought of as running Python in
TensorFlow.

## Modules

`experimental` module: Public API for tf.autograph.experimental namespace.

## Functions

`set_verbosity(...)`: Sets the AutoGraph verbosity level.

`to_code(...)`: Returns the source code generated by AutoGraph, as a string.

`to_graph(...)`: Converts a Python entity into a TensorFlow graph.

`trace(...)`: Traces argument information at compilation time.
