# tf.compat.v1.get_collection_ref

Wrapper for `Graph.get_collection_ref()` using the default graph.

    
    tf.compat.v1.get_collection_ref(
        key
    )
    
See `tf.Graph.get_collection_ref` for more details.

Args  
---  
`key` |  The key for the collection. For example, the `GraphKeys` class contains many standard names for collections.   
Returns  
---  
The list of values in the collection with the given `name`, or an empty list
if no value has been added to that collection. Note that this returns the
collection list itself, which can be modified in place to change the
collection.  
#### Eager Compatibility

Collections are not supported when eager execution is enabled.
