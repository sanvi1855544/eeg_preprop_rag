A 'FlagValues' can then scan command line arguments, passing flag arguments
through to the 'Flag' objects that it owns. It also provides easy access to
the flag values. Typically only one 'FlagValues' object is needed by an
application: flags.FLAGS

This class is heavily overloaded:

'Flag' objects are registered via setitem: FLAGS['longname'] = x # register a
new flag

The .value attribute of the registered 'Flag' objects can be accessed as
attributes of this 'FlagValues' object, through getattr. Both the long and
short name of the original 'Flag' objects can be used to access its value:
FLAGS.longname # parsed flag value FLAGS.x # parsed flag value (short name)

Command line arguments are scanned and passed to the registered 'Flag' objects
through the call method. Unparsed arguments, including argv0 are returned.
argv = FLAGS(sys.argv) # scan command line arguments

The original registered Flag objects can be retrieved through the use of the
dictionary-like operator, getitem: x = FLAGS['longname'] # access the
registered Flag object

The str() operator of a 'FlagValues' object provides help for all of the
registered 'Flag' objects.
