`tf.compat.v1.app.flags.declare_key_flag`

    
    tf.compat.v1.flags.declare_key_flag(
        flag_name, flag_values=_flagvalues.FLAGS
    )
    
Key flags are flags that are deemed really important for a module. They are
important when listing help messages; e.g., if the --helpshort command-line
flag is used, then only the key flags of the main module are listed (instead
of all flags, as in the case of --helpfull).

#### Sample usage:

flags.declare_key_flag('flag_1')

Args  
---  
`flag_name` |  str, the name of an already declared flag. (Redeclaring flags as key, including flags implicitly key because they were declared in this module, is a no-op.)   
`flag_values` |  FlagValues, the FlagValues instance in which the flag will be declared as a key flag. This should almost never need to be overridden.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  Raised if flag_name not defined as a Python flag.
