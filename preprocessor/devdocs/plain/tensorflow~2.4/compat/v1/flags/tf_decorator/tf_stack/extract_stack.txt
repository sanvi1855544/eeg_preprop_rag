`tf.compat.v1.app.flags.tf_decorator.tf_stack.extract_stack`

    
    tf.compat.v1.flags.tf_decorator.tf_stack.extract_stack(
        limit=-1
    )
    
NOTE(mrry): traceback.extract_stack eagerly retrieves the line of code for
each stack frame using linecache, which results in an abundance of stat()
calls. This implementation does not retrieve the code, and any consumer should
apply _convert_stack to the result to obtain a traceback that can be formatted
etc. using traceback methods.

Args  
---  
`limit` |  A limit on the number of frames to return.   
Returns  
---  
A sequence of FrameSummary objects (filename, lineno, name, line)
corresponding to the call stack of the current thread.
