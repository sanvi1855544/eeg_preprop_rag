`tf.compat.v1.math.scalar_mul`

    
    tf.compat.v1.scalar_mul(
        scalar, x, name=None
    )
    
Intended for use in gradient code which might deal with `IndexedSlices`
objects, which are easy to multiply by a scalar but more expensive to multiply
with arbitrary tensors.

Args  
---  
`scalar` |  A 0-D scalar `Tensor`. Must have known shape.   
`x` |  A `Tensor` or `IndexedSlices` to be scaled.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
`scalar * x` of the same type (`Tensor` or `IndexedSlices`) as `x`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if scalar is not a 0-D `scalar`.
