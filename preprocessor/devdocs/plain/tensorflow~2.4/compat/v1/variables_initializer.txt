`tf.compat.v1.initializers.variables`

    
    tf.compat.v1.variables_initializer(
        var_list, name='init'
    )
    
After you launch the graph in a session, you can run the returned Op to
initialize all the variables in `var_list`. This Op runs all the initializers
of the variables in `var_list` in parallel.

Calling `initialize_variables()` is equivalent to passing the list of
initializers to `Group()`.

If `var_list` is empty, however, the function still returns an Op that can be
run. That Op just has no effect.

Args  
---  
`var_list` |  List of `Variable` objects to initialize.   
`name` |  Optional name for the returned operation.   
Returns  
---  
An Op that run the initializers of all the specified variables.
