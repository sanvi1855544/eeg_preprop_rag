# tf.compat.v1.distributions.ReparameterizationType

Instances of this class represent how sampling is reparameterized.

    
    tf.compat.v1.distributions.ReparameterizationType(
        rep_type
    )
    
Two static instances exist in the distributions library, signifying one of two
possible properties for samples from a distribution:

`FULLY_REPARAMETERIZED`: Samples from the distribution are fully
reparameterized, and straight-through gradients are supported.

`NOT_REPARAMETERIZED`: Samples from the distribution are not fully
reparameterized, and straight-through gradients are either partially
unsupported or are not supported at all. In this case, for purposes of e.g. RL
or variational inference, it is generally safest to wrap the sample results in
a `stop_gradients` call and use policy gradients / surrogate loss instead.

## Methods

### `__eq__`

View source

    
    __eq__(
        other
    )
    
Determine if this `ReparameterizationType` is equal to another.

Since ReparameterizationType instances are constant static global instances,
equality checks if two instances' id() values are equal.

Args  
---  
`other` |  Object to compare against.   
Returns  
---  
`self is other`.
