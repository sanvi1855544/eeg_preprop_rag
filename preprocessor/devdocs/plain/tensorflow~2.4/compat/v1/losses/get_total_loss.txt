# tf.compat.v1.losses.get_total_loss

Returns a tensor whose value represents the total loss.

    
    tf.compat.v1.losses.get_total_loss(
        add_regularization_losses=True, name='total_loss', scope=None
    )
    
In particular, this adds any losses you have added with `tf.add_loss()` to any
regularization losses that have been added by regularization parameters on
layers constructors e.g. `tf.layers`. Be very sure to use this if you are
constructing a loss_op manually. Otherwise regularization arguments on
`tf.layers` methods will not function.

Args  
---  
`add_regularization_losses` |  A boolean indicating whether or not to use the regularization losses in the sum.   
`name` |  The name of the returned tensor.   
`scope` |  An optional scope name for filtering the losses to return. Note that this filters the losses added with `tf.add_loss()` as well as the regularization losses to that scope.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` whose value represents the total loss.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if `losses` is not iterable.
