# tf.compat.v1.losses.Reduction

Types of loss reduction.

Contains the following values:

  * `NONE`: Un-reduced weighted losses with the same shape as input.
  * `SUM`: Scalar sum of weighted losses.
  * `MEAN`: Scalar `SUM` divided by sum of weights. DEPRECATED.
  * `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`: Scalar `SUM` divided by number of elements in losses.
  * `SUM_OVER_NONZERO_WEIGHTS`: Scalar `SUM` divided by number of non-zero weights. DEPRECATED.
  * `SUM_BY_NONZERO_WEIGHTS`: Same as `SUM_OVER_NONZERO_WEIGHTS`. DEPRECATED.
