# tf.compat.v1.tpu.rewrite

Rewrites `computation` for execution on a TPU system.

    
    tf.compat.v1.tpu.rewrite(
        computation, inputs=None, infeed_queue=None, device_assignment=None, name=None,
        xla_options=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`computation` |  A Python function that builds a computation to apply to the input. If the function takes n inputs, 'inputs' should be a list of n tensors. `computation` may return a list of operations and tensors. Tensors must come before operations in the returned list. The return value of `rewrite` is a list of tensors corresponding to the tensors from the output of `computation`. All `Operation`s constructed during `computation` will be executed when evaluating any of the returned output tensors, not just the ones returned.   
`inputs` |  A list of input tensors or `None` (equivalent to an empty list). Each input can be a nested structure containing values that are convertible to tensors. Note that passing an N-dimension list of compatible values will result in a N-dimension list of scalar tensors rather than a single Rank-N tensors. If you need different behavior, convert part of inputs to tensors with `tf.convert_to_tensor`.   
`infeed_queue` |  If not `None`, the `InfeedQueue` from which to append a tuple of arguments as inputs to `computation`.   
`device_assignment` |  if not `None`, a `DeviceAssignment` describing the mapping between logical cores in the computation with physical cores in the TPU topology. May be omitted for a single-core computation, in which case the core attached to task 0, TPU device 0 is used.   
`name` |  (Deprecated) Does nothing.   
`xla_options` |  An instance of `tpu.XLAOptions` which indicates the options passed to XLA compiler. Use `None` for default options.   
Returns  
---  
Same data structure as if computation(*inputs) is called directly with some
exceptions for correctness. Exceptions include: 1) None output: a NoOp would
be returned which control-depends on computation. 2) Single value output: A
tuple containing the value would be returned. 3) Operation-only outputs: a
NoOp would be returned which control-depends on computation.
