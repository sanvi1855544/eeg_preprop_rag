    tf.compat.v1.add_to_collection(
        name, value
    )
    
See `tf.Graph.add_to_collection` for more details.

Args  
---  
`name` |  The key for the collection. For example, the `GraphKeys` class contains many standard names for collections.

Collections are only supported in eager when variables are created inside an
EagerVariableStore (e.g. as part of a layer or template).
