# tf.compat.v1.assert_variables_initialized

Returns an Op to check if variables are initialized.

    
    tf.compat.v1.assert_variables_initialized(
        var_list=None
    )
    
> Note: This function is obsolete and will be removed in 6 months. Please
> change your implementation to use `report_uninitialized_variables()`.
When run, the returned Op will raise the exception `FailedPreconditionError`
if any of the variables has not yet been initialized.

> Note: This function is implemented by trying to fetch the values of the
> variables. If one of the variables is not initialized a message may be
> logged by the C++ runtime. This is expected.
