# Module: tf.compat.v1.nn.rnn_cell

Module for constructing RNN Cells.

## Classes

`class BasicLSTMCell`: DEPRECATED: Please use
`tf.compat.v1.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell` instead.

`class BasicRNNCell`: The most basic RNN cell.

`class DeviceWrapper`: Operator that ensures an RNNCell runs on a particular
device.

`class DropoutWrapper`: Operator adding dropout to inputs and outputs of the
given cell.

`class GRUCell`: Gated Recurrent Unit cell.

`class LSTMCell`: Long short-term memory unit (LSTM) recurrent network cell.

`class LSTMStateTuple`: Tuple used by LSTM Cells for `state_size`,
`zero_state`, and output state.

`class MultiRNNCell`: RNN cell composed sequentially of multiple simple cells.

`class RNNCell`: Abstract object representing an RNN cell.

`class ResidualWrapper`: RNNCell wrapper that ensures cell inputs are added to
the outputs.
