# tf.compat.v1.nn.dropout

Computes dropout. (deprecated arguments)

    
    tf.compat.v1.nn.dropout(
        x, keep_prob=None, noise_shape=None, seed=None, name=None, rate=None
    )
    
Warning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(keep_prob)`. They will be removed in
a future version. Instructions for updating: Please use `rate` instead of
`keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.

For each element of `x`, with probability `rate`, outputs `0`, and otherwise
scales up the input by `1 / (1-rate)`. The scaling is such that the expected
sum is unchanged.

By default, each element is kept or dropped independently. If `noise_shape` is
specified, it must be broadcastable to the shape of `x`, and only dimensions
with `noise_shape[i] == shape(x)[i]` will make independent decisions. For
example, if `shape(x) = [k, l, m, n]` and `noise_shape = [k, 1, 1, n]`, each
batch and channel component will be kept independently and each row and column
will be kept or not kept together.

Args  
---  
`x` |  A floating point tensor.   
`keep_prob` |  (deprecated) A deprecated alias for `(1-rate)`.   
`noise_shape` |  A 1-D `Tensor` of type `int32`, representing the shape for randomly generated keep/drop flags.   
`seed` |  A Python integer. Used to create random seeds. See `tf.random.set_seed` for behavior.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional).   
`rate` |  A scalar `Tensor` with the same type as `x`. The probability that each element of `x` is discarded.   
Returns  
---  
A Tensor of the same shape of `x`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `rate` is not in `[0, 1)` or if `x` is not a floating point tensor.
