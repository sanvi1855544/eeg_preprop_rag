# tf.compat.v1.nn.batch_norm_with_global_normalization

Batch normalization.

    
    tf.compat.v1.nn.batch_norm_with_global_normalization(
        t=None, m=None, v=None, beta=None, gamma=None, variance_epsilon=None,
        scale_after_normalization=None, name=None, input=None, mean=None, variance=None
    )
    
This op is deprecated. See `tf.nn.batch_normalization`.

Args  
---  
`t` |  A 4D input Tensor.   
`m` |  A 1D mean Tensor with size matching the last dimension of t. This is the first output from tf.nn.moments, or a saved moving average thereof.   
`v` |  A 1D variance Tensor with size matching the last dimension of t. This is the second output from tf.nn.moments, or a saved moving average thereof.   
`beta` |  A 1D beta Tensor with size matching the last dimension of t. An offset to be added to the normalized tensor.   
`gamma` |  A 1D gamma Tensor with size matching the last dimension of t. If "scale_after_normalization" is true, this tensor will be multiplied with the normalized tensor.   
`variance_epsilon` |  A small float number to avoid dividing by 0.   
`scale_after_normalization` |  A bool indicating whether the resulted tensor needs to be multiplied with gamma.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional).   
`input` |  Alias for t.   
`mean` |  Alias for m.   
`variance` |  Alias for v.   
Returns  
---  
A batch-normalized `t`.
