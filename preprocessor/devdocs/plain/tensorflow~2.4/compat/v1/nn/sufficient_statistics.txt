# tf.compat.v1.nn.sufficient_statistics

Calculate the sufficient statistics for the mean and variance of `x`.

    
    tf.compat.v1.nn.sufficient_statistics(
        x, axes, shift=None, keep_dims=None, name=None, keepdims=None
    )
    
These sufficient statistics are computed using the one pass algorithm on an
input that's optionally shifted. See:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Computing_shifted_data

#### For example:

    
    t = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    sufficient_statistics(t, [1])
    (<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int32, numpy=3>, <tf.Tensor: shape=(2,),
    dtype=int32, numpy=array([ 6, 15], dtype=int32)>, <tf.Tensor: shape=(2,),
    dtype=int32, numpy=array([14, 77], dtype=int32)>, None)
    sufficient_statistics(t, [-1])
    (<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int32, numpy=3>, <tf.Tensor: shape=(2,),
    dtype=int32, numpy=array([ 6, 15], dtype=int32)>, <tf.Tensor: shape=(2,),
    dtype=int32, numpy=array([14, 77], dtype=int32)>, None)
    
Args  
---  
`x` |  A `Tensor`.   
`axes` |  Array of ints. Axes along which to compute mean and variance. As in Python, the axes can also be negative numbers. A negative axis is interpreted as counting from the end of the rank, i.e., axis + rank(values)-th dimension.   
`shift` |  A `Tensor` containing the value by which to shift the data for numerical stability, or `None` if no shift is to be performed. A shift close to the true mean provides the most numerically stable results.   
`keep_dims` |  produce statistics with the same dimensionality as the input.   
`name` |  Name used to scope the operations that compute the sufficient stats.   
`keepdims` |  Alias for keep_dims.   
Returns  
---  
Four `Tensor` objects of the same type as `x`:

  * the count (number of elements to average over).
  * the (possibly shifted) sum of the elements in the array.
  * the (possibly shifted) sum of squares of the elements in the array.
  * the shift by which the mean must be corrected or None if `shift` is None.
