# tf.compat.v1.executing_eagerly_outside_functions

Returns True if executing eagerly, even if inside a graph function.

    
    tf.compat.v1.executing_eagerly_outside_functions()
    
This function will check the outermost context for the program and see if it
is in eager mode. It is useful comparing to `tf.executing_eagerly()`, which
checks the current context and will return `False` within a `tf.function`
body. It can be used to build library that behave differently in eager runtime
and v1 session runtime (deprecated).

#### Example:

    
    tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()
    @tf.function
    def func():
      # A function constructs TensorFlow graphs, it does not execute eagerly,
      # but the outer most context is still eager.
      assert not tf.executing_eagerly()
      return tf.compat.v1.executing_eagerly_outside_functions()
    func()
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=bool, numpy=True>
    
Returns  
---  
boolean, whether the outermost context is in eager mode.
