# tf.compat.v1.add_check_numerics_ops

Connect a `tf.debugging.check_numerics` to every floating point tensor.

    
    tf.compat.v1.add_check_numerics_ops()
    
`check_numerics` operations themselves are added for each `half`, `float`, or
`double` tensor in the current default graph. For all ops in the graph, the
`check_numerics` op for all of its (`half`, `float`, or `double`) inputs is
guaranteed to run before the `check_numerics` op on any of its outputs.

> Note: This API is not compatible with the use of `tf.cond` or
> `tf.while_loop`, and will raise a `ValueError` if you attempt to call it in
> such a graph.
Returns  
---  
A `group` op depending on all `check_numerics` ops added.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the graph contains any numeric operations in a control flow structure.   
`RuntimeError` |  If called with eager execution enabled.   
#### Eager Compatibility

Not compatible with eager execution. To check for `Inf`s and `NaN`s under
eager execution, call `tf.debugging.enable_check_numerics()` once before
executing the checked operations.
