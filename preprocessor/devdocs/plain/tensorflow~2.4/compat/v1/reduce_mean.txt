`tf.compat.v1.math.reduce_mean`

    
    tf.compat.v1.reduce_mean(
        input_tensor, axis=None, keepdims=None, name=None, reduction_indices=None,
        keep_dims=None
    )
    
Reduces `input_tensor` along the dimensions given in `axis` by computing the
mean of elements across the dimensions in `axis`. Unless `keepdims` is true,
the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each the entries in `axis`, which
must be unique. If `keepdims` is true, the reduced dimensions are retained
with length 1.

If `axis` is None, all dimensions are reduced, and a tensor with a single
element is returned.

#### For example:

    
    x = tf.constant([[1., 1.], [2., 2.]])
    tf.reduce_mean(x)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=1.5>
    tf.reduce_mean(x, 0)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2,), dtype=float32, numpy=array([1.5, 1.5], dtype=float32)>
    tf.reduce_mean(x, 1)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2,), dtype=float32, numpy=array([1., 2.], dtype=float32)>
    
Args  
---  
`input_tensor` |  The tensor to reduce. Should have numeric type.   
`axis` |  The dimensions to reduce. If `None` (the default), reduces all dimensions. Must be in the range `[-rank(input_tensor), rank(input_tensor))`.   
`keepdims` |  If true, retains reduced dimensions with length 1.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
`reduction_indices` |  The old (deprecated) name for axis.   
`keep_dims` |  Deprecated alias for `keepdims`.   
Returns  
---  
The reduced tensor.  
#### Numpy Compatibility

Equivalent to np.mean

Please note that `np.mean` has a `dtype` parameter that could be used to
specify the output type. By default this is `dtype=float64`. On the other
hand, `tf.reduce_mean` has an aggressive type inference from `input_tensor`,
for example:

    
    x = tf.constant([1, 0, 1, 0])
    tf.reduce_mean(x)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int32, numpy=0>
    y = tf.constant([1., 0., 1., 0.])
    tf.reduce_mean(y)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=0.5>
