Some common use cases of functions on this page:

  * Locality

`tf.distribute.DistributedValues` can have the same locality as a distributed
variable, which leads to a mirrored value residing on the same devices as the
variable (as opposed to the compute devices). Such values may be passed to a
call to `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.update` to update the value of a
variable. You may use `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.colocate_vars_with` to
give a variable the same locality as another variable. You may convert a
"PerReplica" value to a variable's locality by using
`tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.reduce_to` or
`tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.batch_reduce_to`.

  * How to update a distributed variable

A distributed variable is variables created on multiple devices. As discussed
in the glossary, mirrored variable and SyncOnRead variable are two examples.
The standard pattern for updating distributed variables is to:

  1. In your function passed to `tf.distribute.Strategy.run`, compute a list of (update, variable) pairs. For example, the update might be a gradient of the loss with respect to the variable.
  2. Switch to cross-replica mode by calling `tf.distribute.get_replica_context().merge_call()` with the updates and variables as arguments.
  3. Call `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.reduce_to(VariableAggregation.SUM, t, v)` (for one variable) or `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.batch_reduce_to` (for a list of variables) to sum the updates.
  4. Call `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.update(v)` for each variable to update its value.

Steps 2 through 4 are done automatically by class
`tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer` if you call its
`tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer.apply_gradients` method in a replica context.

In fact, a higher-level solution to update a distributed variable is by
calling `assign` on the variable as you would do to a regular `tf.Variable`.
You can call the method in both replica context and cross-replica context. For
a mirrored variable, calling `assign` in replica context requires you to
specify the `aggregation` type in the variable constructor. In that case, the
context switching and sync described in steps 2 through 4 are handled for you.
If you call `assign` on mirrored variable in cross-replica context, you can
only assign a single value or assign values from another mirrored variable or
a mirrored `tf.distribute.DistributedValues`. For a SyncOnRead variable, in
replica context, you can simply call `assign` on it and no aggregation happens
under the hood. In cross-replica context, you can only assign a single value
to a SyncOnRead variable. One example case is restoring from a checkpoint: if
the `aggregation` type of the variable is `tf.VariableAggregation.SUM`, it is
assumed that replica values were added before checkpointing, so at the time of
restoring, the value is divided by the number of replicas and then assigned to
each replica; if the `aggregation` type is `tf.VariableAggregation.MEAN`, the
value is assigned to each replica directly.

## Methods

### `batch_reduce_to`

View source

    
    batch_reduce_to(
        reduce_op, value_destination_pairs, options=None
    )
    
Combine multiple `reduce_to` calls into one for faster execution.

Similar to `reduce_to`, but accepts a list of (value, destinations) pairs.
It's more efficient than reduce each value separately.

This API currently can only be called in cross-replica context. Other variants
to reduce values across replicas are:

  * `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.reduce_to`: the non-batch version of this API.
  * `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_reduce`: the counterpart of this API in replica context. It supports both batched and non-batched all-reduce.
  * `tf.distribute.Strategy.reduce`: a more convenient method to reduce to the host in cross-replica context.

See `reduce_to` for more information.

    run(tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy(["GPU:0", "GPU:1"]))
    MirroredVariable:{
      0: <tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=() dtype=float32, numpy=2.0>,
      1: <tf.Variable 'Variable/replica_1:0' shape=() dtype=float32, numpy=2.0>

    run(tf.distribute.OneDeviceStrategy("GPU:0"))
    <tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=() dtype=float32, numpy=1.0>
    
Args  
---  
`reduce_op` |  a `tf.distribute.ReduceOp` value specifying how values should be combined. Allows using string representation of the enum such as "SUM", "MEAN".   
`value_destination_pairs` |  a sequence of (value, destinations) pairs. See `tf.distribute.Strategy.reduce_to` for descriptions.   
`options` |  a `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions`. Options to perform collective operations. This overrides the default options if the `tf.distribute.Strategy` takes one in the constructor. See `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions` for details of the options.   
Returns  
---  
A list of reduced values, one per pair in `value_destination_pairs`.  
### `broadcast_to`

View source

    
    broadcast_to(
        tensor, destinations
    )
    
Mirror a tensor on one device to all worker devices.

Args  
---  
`tensor` |  A Tensor value to broadcast.   
`destinations` |  A mirrored variable or device string specifying the destination devices to copy `tensor` to.   
Returns  
---  
A value mirrored to `destinations` devices.  
### `call_for_each_replica`

View source

    
    call_for_each_replica(
        fn, args=(), kwargs=None
    )
    
Run `fn` once per replica.

`fn` may call `tf.get_replica_context()` to access methods such as
`replica_id_in_sync_group` and `merge_call()`.

`merge_call()` is used to communicate between the replicas and re-enter the
cross-replica context. All replicas pause their execution having encountered a
`merge_call()` call. After that the `merge_fn`-function is executed. Its
results are then unwrapped and given back to each replica call. After that
execution resumes until `fn` is complete or encounters another `merge_call()`.
Example:

    
    # Called once in "cross-replica" context.
    def merge_fn(distribution, three_plus_replica_id):
      # sum the values across replicas
      return sum(distribution.experimental_local_results(three_plus_replica_id))
    
    # Called once per replica in `distribution`, in a "replica" context.
    def fn(three):
      replica_ctx = tf.get_replica_context()
      v = three + replica_ctx.replica_id_in_sync_group
      # Computes the sum of the `v` values across all replicas.
      s = replica_ctx.merge_call(merge_fn, args=(v,))
      return s + v
    
    with distribution.scope():
      # in "cross-replica" context
      ...
      merged_results = distribution.run(fn, args=[3])
      # merged_results has the values from every replica execution of `fn`.
      # This statement prints a list:
      print(distribution.experimental_local_results(merged_results))
    
Args  
---  
`fn` |  function to run (will be run once per replica).   
`args` |  Tuple or list with positional arguments for `fn`.   
`kwargs` |  Dict with keyword arguments for `fn`.   
Returns  
---  
Merged return value of `fn` across all replicas.  
### `colocate_vars_with`

View source

    
    colocate_vars_with(
        colocate_with_variable
    )
    
Scope that controls which devices variables will be created on.

No operations should be added to the graph inside this scope, it should only
be used when creating variables (some implementations work by changing
variable creation, others work by using a tf.compat.v1.colocate_with() scope).

This may only be used inside `self.scope()`.

#### Example usage:

    
    with strategy.scope():
      var1 = tf.Variable(...)
      with strategy.extended.colocate_vars_with(var1):
        # var2 and var3 will be created on the same device(s) as var1
        var2 = tf.Variable(...)
        var3 = tf.Variable(...)
    
      def fn(v1, v2, v3):
        # operates on v1 from var1, v2 from var2, and v3 from var3
    
      # `fn` runs on every device `var1` is on, `var2` and `var3` will be there
      # too.
      strategy.extended.update(var1, fn, args=(var2, var3))
    
Args  
---  
`colocate_with_variable` |  A variable created in this strategy's `scope()`. Variables created while in the returned context manager will be on the same set of devices as `colocate_with_variable`.   
Returns  
---  
A context manager.  
### `experimental_make_numpy_dataset`

View source

    
    experimental_make_numpy_dataset(
        numpy_input, session=None
    )
    
Makes a dataset for input provided via a numpy array.

This avoids adding `numpy_input` as a large constant in the graph, and copies
the data to the machine or machines that will be processing the input.

Args  
---  
`numpy_input` |  A nest of NumPy input arrays that will be distributed evenly across all replicas. Note that lists of Numpy arrays are stacked, as that is normal `tf.data.Dataset` behavior.   
`session` |  (TensorFlow v1.x graph execution only) A session used for initialization.   
Returns  
---  
A `tf.data.Dataset` representing `numpy_input`.  
### `experimental_run_steps_on_iterator`

View source

    
    experimental_run_steps_on_iterator(
        fn, iterator, iterations=1, initial_loop_values=None
    )
    
DEPRECATED: please use `run` instead.

Run `fn` with input from `iterator` for `iterations` times.

This method can be used to run a step function for training a number of times
using input from a dataset.

Args  
---  
`fn` |  function to run using this distribution strategy. The function must have the following signature: `def fn(context, inputs)`. `context` is an instance of `MultiStepContext` that will be passed when `fn` is run. `context` can be used to specify the outputs to be returned from `fn` by calling `context.set_last_step_output`. It can also be used to capture non tensor outputs by `context.set_non_tensor_output`. See `MultiStepContext` documentation for more information. `inputs` will have same type/structure as `iterator.get_next()`. Typically, `fn` will use `call_for_each_replica` method of the strategy to distribute the computation over multiple replicas.   
`iterator` |  Iterator of a dataset that represents the input for `fn`. The caller is responsible for initializing the iterator as needed.   
`iterations` |  (Optional) Number of iterations that `fn` should be run. Defaults to 1.   
`initial_loop_values` |  (Optional) Initial values to be passed into the loop that runs `fn`. Defaults to `None`. initial_loop_values argument when we have a mechanism to infer the outputs of `fn`.   
Returns  
---  
Returns the `MultiStepContext` object which has the following properties,
among other things:

  * run_op: An op that runs `fn` `iterations` times.
  * last_step_outputs: A dictionary containing tensors set using `context.set_last_step_output`. Evaluating this returns the value of the tensors after the last iteration.
  * non_tensor_outputs: A dictionary containing anything that was set by `fn` by calling `context.set_non_tensor_output`. 

  
### `non_slot_devices`

View source

    
    non_slot_devices(
        var_list
    )
    
Device(s) for non-slot variables.

DEPRECATED: TF 1.x ONLY.

This method returns non-slot devices where non-slot variables are placed.
Users can create non-slot variables on these devices by using a block:

    
    with tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.colocate_vars_with(tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.non_slot_devices(...)):
      ...
    
Args  
---  
`var_list` |  The list of variables being optimized, needed with the default `tf.distribute.Strategy`.   
Returns  
---  
A sequence of devices for non-slot variables.  
### `read_var`

View source

    
    read_var(
        v
    )
    
Reads the value of a variable.

Returns the aggregate value of a replica-local variable, or the (read-only)
value of any other variable.

Args  
---  
`v` |  A variable allocated within the scope of this `tf.distribute.Strategy`.   
Returns  
---  
A tensor representing the value of `v`, aggregated across replicas if
necessary.  
### `reduce_to`

View source

    
    reduce_to(
        reduce_op, value, destinations, options=None
    )
    
Combine (via e.g. sum or mean) values across replicas.

`reduce_to` aggregates `tf.distribute.DistributedValues` and distributed
variables. It supports both dense values and `tf.IndexedSlices`.

This API currently can only be called in cross-replica context. Other variants
to reduce values across replicas are:

  * `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.batch_reduce_to`: the batch version of this API.
  * `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_reduce`: the counterpart of this API in replica context. It supports both batched and non-batched all-reduce.
  * `tf.distribute.Strategy.reduce`: a more convenient method to reduce to the host in cross-replica context.

`destinations` specifies where to reduce the value to, e.g. "GPU:0". You can
also pass in a `Tensor`, and the destinations will be the device of that
tensor. For all-reduce, pass the same to `value` and `destinations`.

It can be used in `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.merge_call` to write code that
works for all `tf.distribute.Strategy`.

    
    @tf.function
    def step_fn(var):
    
      def merge_fn(strategy, value, var):
        # All-reduce the value. Note that `value` here is a
        # `tf.distribute.DistributedValues`.
        reduced = strategy.extended.reduce_to(tf.distribute.ReduceOp.SUM,
            value, destinations=var)
        strategy.extended.update(var, lambda var, value: var.assign(value),
            args=(reduced,))
    
      value = tf.identity(1.)
      tf.distribute.get_replica_context().merge_call(merge_fn,
        args=(value, var))
    
    def run(strategy):
      with strategy.scope():
        v = tf.Variable(0.)
        strategy.run(step_fn, args=(v,))
        return v
    
    run(tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy(["GPU:0", "GPU:1"]))
    MirroredVariable:{
      0: <tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=() dtype=float32, numpy=2.0>,
      1: <tf.Variable 'Variable/replica_1:0' shape=() dtype=float32, numpy=2.0>
    }
    run(tf.distribute.experimental.CentralStorageStrategy(
        compute_devices=["GPU:0", "GPU:1"], parameter_device="CPU:0"))
    <tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=() dtype=float32, numpy=2.0>
    run(tf.distribute.OneDeviceStrategy("GPU:0"))
    <tf.Variable 'Variable:0' shape=() dtype=float32, numpy=1.0>
    
Args  
---  
`reduce_op` |  a `tf.distribute.ReduceOp` value specifying how values should be combined. Allows using string representation of the enum such as "SUM", "MEAN".   
`value` |  a `tf.distribute.DistributedValues`, or a `tf.Tensor` like object.   
`destinations` |  a `tf.distribute.DistributedValues`, a `tf.Variable`, a `tf.Tensor` alike object, or a device string. It specifies the devices to reduce to. To perform an all-reduce, pass the same to `value` and `destinations`. Note that if it's a `tf.Variable`, the value is reduced to the devices of that variable, and this method doesn't update the variable.   
`options` |  a `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions`. Options to perform collective operations. This overrides the default options if the `tf.distribute.Strategy` takes one in the constructor. See `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions` for details of the options.   
Returns  
---  
A tensor or value reduced to `destinations`.  
### `update`

View source

    
    update(
        var, fn, args=(), kwargs=None, group=True
    )
    
Run `fn` to update `var` using inputs mirrored to the same devices.

`tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.update` takes a distributed variable `var` to
be updated, an update function `fn`, and `args` and `kwargs` for `fn`. It
applies `fn` to each component variable of `var` and passes corresponding
values from `args` and `kwargs`. Neither `args` nor `kwargs` may contain per-
replica values. If they contain mirrored values, they will be unwrapped before
calling `fn`. For example, `fn` can be `assign_add` and `args` can be a
mirrored DistributedValues where each component contains the value to be added
to this mirrored variable `var`. Calling `update` will call `assign_add` on
each component variable of `var` with the corresponding tensor value on that
device.

#### Example usage:

    
    strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy(['GPU:0', 'GPU:1']) # With 2
    devices
    with strategy.scope():
      v = tf.Variable(5.0, aggregation=tf.VariableAggregation.SUM)
    def update_fn(v):
      return v.assign(1.0)
    result = strategy.extended.update(v, update_fn)
    # result is
    # Mirrored:{
    #  0: tf.Tensor(1.0, shape=(), dtype=float32),
    #  1: tf.Tensor(1.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
    # }
    
If `var` is mirrored across multiple devices, then this method implements
logic as following:

    
    results = {}
    for device, v in var:
      with tf.device(device):
        # args and kwargs will be unwrapped if they are mirrored.
        results[device] = fn(v, *args, **kwargs)
    return merged(results)
    
Otherwise, this method returns `fn(var, *args, **kwargs)` colocated with
`var`.

Args  
---  
`var` |  Variable, possibly mirrored to multiple devices, to operate on.   
`fn` |  Function to call. Should take the variable as the first argument.   
`args` |  Tuple or list. Additional positional arguments to pass to `fn()`.   
`kwargs` |  Dict with keyword arguments to pass to `fn()`.   
`group` |  Boolean. Defaults to True. If False, the return value will be unwrapped.   
Returns  
---  
By default, the merged return value of `fn` across all replicas. The merged
result has dependencies to make sure that if it is evaluated at all, the side
effects (updates) will happen on every replica. If instead "group=False" is
specified, this function will return a nest of lists where each list has an
element per replica, and the caller is responsible for ensuring all elements
are executed.  
### `update_non_slot`

View source

    
    update_non_slot(
        colocate_with, fn, args=(), kwargs=None, group=True
    )
    
Runs `fn(*args, **kwargs)` on `colocate_with` devices.

Used to update non-slot variables.

DEPRECATED: TF 1.x ONLY.

Args  
---  
`colocate_with` |  Devices returned by `non_slot_devices()`.   
`fn` |  Function to execute.   
`args` |  Tuple or list. Positional arguments to pass to `fn()`.   
`kwargs` |  Dict with keyword arguments to pass to `fn()`.   
`group` |  Boolean. Defaults to True. If False, the return value will be unwrapped.   
Returns  
---  
Return value of `fn`, possibly merged across devices.  
### `value_container`

View source

    
    value_container(
        value
    )
    
Returns the container that this per-replica `value` belongs to.

Args  
---  
`value` |  A value returned by `run()` or a variable created in `scope()`.   
Returns  
---  
A container that `value` belongs to. If value does not belong to any container
(including the case of container having been destroyed), returns the value
itself. `value in experimental_local_results(value_container(value))` will
always be true.  
### `variable_created_in_scope`

View source

    
    variable_created_in_scope(
        v
    )
    
Tests whether `v` was created while this strategy scope was active.

Variables created inside the strategy scope are "owned" by it:

    
    strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
    with strategy.scope():
      v = tf.Variable(1.)
    strategy.extended.variable_created_in_scope(v)
    True
    
Variables created outside the strategy are not owned by it:

    
    strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
    v = tf.Variable(1.)
    strategy.extended.variable_created_in_scope(v)
    False
    
Args  
---  
`v` |  A `tf.Variable` instance.   
Returns  
---  
True if `v` was created inside the scope, False if not.
