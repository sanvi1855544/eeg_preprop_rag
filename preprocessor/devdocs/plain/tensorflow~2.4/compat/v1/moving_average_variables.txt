# tf.compat.v1.moving_average_variables

Returns all variables that maintain their moving averages.

    
    tf.compat.v1.moving_average_variables(
        scope=None
    )
    
If an `ExponentialMovingAverage` object is created and the `apply()` method is
called on a list of variables, these variables will be added to the
`GraphKeys.MOVING_AVERAGE_VARIABLES` collection. This convenience function
returns the contents of that collection.

Args  
---  
`scope` |  (Optional.) A string. If supplied, the resulting list is filtered to include only items whose `name` attribute matches `scope` using `re.match`. Items without a `name` attribute are never returned if a scope is supplied. The choice of `re.match` means that a `scope` without special tokens filters by prefix.   
Returns  
---  
A list of Variable objects.
