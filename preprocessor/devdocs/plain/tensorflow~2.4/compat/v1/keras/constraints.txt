# Module: tf.compat.v1.keras.constraints

Constraints: functions that impose constraints on weight values.

## Classes

`class Constraint`

`class MaxNorm`: MaxNorm weight constraint.

`class MinMaxNorm`: MinMaxNorm weight constraint.

`class NonNeg`: Constrains the weights to be non-negative.

`class RadialConstraint`: Constrains `Conv2D` kernel weights to be the same
for each radius.

`class UnitNorm`: Constrains the weights incident to each hidden unit to have
unit norm.

`class max_norm`: MaxNorm weight constraint.

`class min_max_norm`: MinMaxNorm weight constraint.

`class non_neg`: Constrains the weights to be non-negative.

`class radial_constraint`: Constrains `Conv2D` kernel weights to be the same
for each radius.

`class unit_norm`: Constrains the weights incident to each hidden unit to have
unit norm.
