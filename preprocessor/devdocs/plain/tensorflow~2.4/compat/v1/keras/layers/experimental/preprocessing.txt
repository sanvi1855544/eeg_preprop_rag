`class PreprocessingLayer`: Base class for PreprocessingLayers.

`class RandomContrast`: Adjust the contrast of an image or images by a random
factor.

`class RandomCrop`: Randomly crop the images to target height and width.

`class RandomFlip`: Randomly flip each image horizontally and vertically.

`class RandomHeight`: Randomly vary the height of a batch of images during
training.
