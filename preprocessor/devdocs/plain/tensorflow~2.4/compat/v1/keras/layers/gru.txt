    tf.compat.v1.keras.layers.GRU(
        units, activation='tanh',
        recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid', use_bias=True,
        kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform',
        recurrent_initializer='orthogonal',
        bias_initializer='zeros', kernel_regularizer=None,
        recurrent_regularizer=None, bias_regularizer=None, activity_regularizer=None,

        dropout=0.0, recurrent_dropout=0.0, return_sequences=False, return_state=False,

There are two variants. The default one is based on 1406.1078v3 and has reset
gate applied to hidden state before matrix multiplication. The other one is
based on original 1406.1078v1 and has the order reversed.

The second variant is compatible with CuDNNGRU (GPU-only) and allows inference
on CPU. Thus it has separate biases for `kernel` and `recurrent_kernel`. Use
`'reset_after'=True` and `recurrent_activation='sigmoid'`.

Arguments  
---  
`units` |  Positive integer, dimensionality of the output space.   
`activation` |  Activation function to use. Default: hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`). If you pass `None`, no activation is applied (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).   
`recurrent_activation` |  Activation function to use for the recurrent step. Default: hard sigmoid (`hard_sigmoid`). If you pass `None`, no activation is applied (ie. "linear" activation: `a(x) = x`).   
`use_bias` |  Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.   
`kernel_initializer` |  Initializer for the `kernel` weights matrix, used for the linear transformation of the inputs.   
`recurrent_initializer` |  Initializer for the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix, used for the linear transformation of the recurrent state.   
`bias_initializer` |  Initializer for the bias vector.   
`kernel_regularizer` |  Regularizer function applied to the `kernel` weights matrix.   
`recurrent_regularizer` |  Regularizer function applied to the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix.   
`bias_regularizer` |  Regularizer function applied to the bias vector.   
`activity_regularizer` |  Regularizer function applied to the output of the layer (its "activation")..   
`kernel_constraint` |  Constraint function applied to the `kernel` weights matrix.   
`recurrent_constraint` |  Constraint function applied to the `recurrent_kernel` weights matrix.   
`bias_constraint` |  Constraint function applied to the bias vector.   
`dropout` |  Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the units to drop for the linear transformation of the inputs.   
`recurrent_dropout` |  Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the units to drop for the linear transformation of the recurrent state.   
`return_sequences` |  Boolean. Whether to return the last output in the output sequence, or the full sequence.   
`return_state` |  Boolean. Whether to return the last state in addition to the output.   
`go_backwards` |  Boolean (default False). If True, process the input sequence backwards and return the reversed sequence.   
`stateful` |  Boolean (default False). If True, the last state for each sample at index i in a batch will be used as initial state for the sample of index i in the following batch.   
`unroll` |  Boolean (default False). If True, the network will be unrolled, else a symbolic loop will be used. Unrolling can speed-up a RNN, although it tends to be more memory-intensive. Unrolling is only suitable for short sequences.   
`time_major` |  The shape format of the `inputs` and `outputs` tensors. If True, the inputs and outputs will be in shape `(timesteps, batch, ...)`, whereas in the False case, it will be `(batch, timesteps, ...)`. Using `time_major = True` is a bit more efficient because it avoids transposes at the beginning and end of the RNN calculation. However, most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by default this function accepts input and emits output in batch-major form.   
`reset_after` |  GRU convention (whether to apply reset gate after or before matrix multiplication). False = "before" (default), True = "after" (CuDNN compatible).   
#### Call arguments:

  * `inputs`: A 3D tensor.
  * `mask`: Binary tensor of shape `(samples, timesteps)` indicating whether a given timestep should be masked.
  * `training`: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in training mode or in inference mode. This argument is passed to the cell when calling it. This is only relevant if `dropout` or `recurrent_dropout` is used.
  * `initial_state`: List of initial state tensors to be passed to the first call of the cell.

## Methods

### `reset_states`

View source

    
    reset_states(
        states=None
    )
    
Reset the recorded states for the stateful RNN layer.

Can only be used when RNN layer is constructed with `stateful` = `True`. Args:
states: Numpy arrays that contains the value for the initial state, which will
be feed to cell at the first time step. When the value is None, zero filled
numpy array will be created based on the cell state size.

Raises  
---  
`AttributeError` |  When the RNN layer is not stateful.   
`ValueError` |  When the batch size of the RNN layer is unknown.   
`ValueError` |  When the input numpy array is not compatible with the RNN layer state, either size wise or dtype wise.
