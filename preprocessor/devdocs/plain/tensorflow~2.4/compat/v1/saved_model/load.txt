`tf.compat.v1.saved_model.loader.load`

    
    tf.compat.v1.saved_model.load(
        sess, tags, export_dir, import_scope=None, **saver_kwargs
    )
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating: This function will only be available through the v1
compatibility library as tf.compat.v1.saved_model.loader.load or
tf.compat.v1.saved_model.load. There will be a new function for importing
SavedModels in Tensorflow 2.0. Args  
---  
`sess` |  The TensorFlow session to restore the variables.   
`tags` |  Set of string tags to identify the required MetaGraphDef. These should correspond to the tags used when saving the variables using the SavedModel `save()` API.   
`export_dir` |  Directory in which the SavedModel protocol buffer and variables to be loaded are located.   
`import_scope` |  Optional `string` \-- if specified, prepend this string followed by '/' to all loaded tensor names. This scope is applied to tensor instances loaded into the passed session, but it is not written through to the static `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer that is returned.   
`**saver_kwargs` |  Optional keyword arguments passed through to Saver.   
Returns  
---  
The `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer loaded in the provided session. This can be
used to further extract signature-defs, collection-defs, etc.  
Raises  
---  
`RuntimeError` |  MetaGraphDef associated with the tags cannot be found.
