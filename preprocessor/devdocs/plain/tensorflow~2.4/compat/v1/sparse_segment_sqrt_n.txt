`tf.compat.v1.sparse.segment_sqrt_n`

    
    tf.compat.v1.sparse_segment_sqrt_n(
        data, indices, segment_ids, name=None, num_segments=None
    )
    
`N` is the size of the segment being reduced.

Args  
---  
`data` |  A `Tensor` with data that will be assembled in the output.   
`indices` |  A 1-D `Tensor` with indices into `data`. Has same rank as `segment_ids`.   
`segment_ids` |  A 1-D `Tensor` with indices into the output `Tensor`. Values should be sorted and can be repeated.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
`num_segments` |  An optional int32 scalar. Indicates the size of the output `Tensor`.   
Returns  
---  
A `tensor` of the shape as data, except for dimension 0 which has size `k`,
the number of segments specified via `num_segments` or inferred for the last
element in `segments_ids`.
