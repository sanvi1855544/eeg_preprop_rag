# tf.compat.v1.lite.experimental.convert_op_hints_to_stubs

Converts a graphdef with LiteOp hints into stub operations.

    
    tf.compat.v1.lite.experimental.convert_op_hints_to_stubs(
        session=None, graph_def=None, write_callback=(lambda graph_def, comments: None)
    )
    
This is used to prepare for toco conversion of complex intrinsic usages. Note:
only one of session or graph_def should be used, not both.

Args  
---  
`session` |  A TensorFlow session that contains the graph to convert.   
`graph_def` |  A graph def that we should convert.   
`write_callback` |  A function pointer that can be used to write intermediate steps of graph transformation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A new graphdef with all ops contained in OpHints being replaced by a single op
call with the right parameters.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If both session and graph_def are provided.
