# tf.compat.v1.VariableAggregation

Indicates how a distributed variable will be aggregated.

`tf.distribute.Strategy` distributes a model by making multiple copies (called
"replicas") acting data-parallel on different elements of the input batch.
When performing some variable-update operation, say `var.assign_add(x)`, in a
model, we need to resolve how to combine the different values for `x` computed
in the different replicas.

  * `NONE`: This is the default, giving an error if you use a variable-update operation with multiple replicas.
  * `SUM`: Add the updates across replicas.
  * `MEAN`: Take the arithmetic mean ("average") of the updates across replicas.
  * `ONLY_FIRST_REPLICA`: This is for when every replica is performing the same update, but we only want to perform the update once. Used, e.g., for the global step counter.
  * `ONLY_FIRST_TOWER`: Deprecated alias for `ONLY_FIRST_REPLICA`.
