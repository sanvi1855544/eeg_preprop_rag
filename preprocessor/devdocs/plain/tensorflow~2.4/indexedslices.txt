`tf.compat.v1.IndexedSlices`

    
    tf.IndexedSlices(
        values, indices, dense_shape=None
    )
    
This class is a simple wrapper for a pair of `Tensor` objects:

  * `values`: A `Tensor` of any dtype with shape `[D0, D1, ..., Dn]`.
  * `indices`: A 1-D integer `Tensor` with shape `[D0]`.

An `IndexedSlices` is typically used to represent a subset of a larger tensor
`dense` of shape `[LARGE0, D1, .. , DN]` where `LARGE0 >> D0`. The values in
`indices` are the indices in the first dimension of the slices that have been
extracted from the larger tensor. The dense tensor `dense` represented by an
`IndexedSlices` `slices` has

    
    dense[slices.indices[i], :, :, :, ...] = slices.values[i, :, :, :, ...]
    
The `IndexedSlices` class is used principally in the definition of gradients for operations that have sparse gradients (e.g. `tf.gather`). Contrast this representation with `tf.sparse.SparseTensor`, which uses multi-dimensional indices and scalar values. | Attributes  
---  
`dense_shape` |  A 1-D `Tensor` containing the shape of the corresponding dense tensor.   
`device` |  The name of the device on which `values` will be produced, or `None`.   
`dtype` |  The `DType` of elements in this tensor.   
`graph` |  The `Graph` that contains the values, indices, and shape tensors.   
`indices` |  A 1-D `Tensor` containing the indices of the slices.   
`name` |  The name of this `IndexedSlices`.   
`op` |  The `Operation` that produces `values` as an output.   
`shape` |  Gets the `tf.TensorShape` representing the shape of the dense tensor.   
`values` |  A `Tensor` containing the values of the slices.
