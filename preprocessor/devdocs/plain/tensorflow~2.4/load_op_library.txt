    tf.load_op_library(
        library_filename
    )
    
Pass "library_filename" to a platform-specific mechanism for dynamically loading a library. The rules for determining the exact location of the library are platform-specific and are not documented here. When the library is loaded, ops and kernels registered in the library via the `REGISTER_*` macros are made available in the TensorFlow process. Note that ops with the same name as an existing op are rejected and not registered with the process. | Args  
---  
`library_filename` |  Path to the plugin. Relative or absolute filesystem path to a dynamic library file.   
Returns  
---  
A python module containing the Python wrappers for Ops defined in the plugin.  
Raises  
---  
`RuntimeError` |  when unable to load the library or get the python wrappers.
