    tf.is_tensor(
        x
    )
    
Use is_tensor to differentiate types that can ingested by TensorFlow ops
without any conversion (e.g., `tf.Tensor`, `tf.SparseTensor`, and
`tf.RaggedTensor`) from types that need to be converted into tensors before
they are ingested (e.g., numpy `ndarray` and Python scalars). For example, in
the following code block:

    
    if not tf.is_tensor(t):
      t = tf.convert_to_tensor(t)
    return t.dtype
    
we check to make sure that `t` is a tensor (and convert it if not) before accessing its `shape` and `dtype`. | Args  
---  
`x` |  A python object to check.   
Returns  
---  
`True` if `x` is a tensor or "tensor-like", `False` if not.
