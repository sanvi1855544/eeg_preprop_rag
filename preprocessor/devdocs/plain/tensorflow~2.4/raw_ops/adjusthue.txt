`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.AdjustHue`

    
    tf.raw_ops.AdjustHue(
        images, delta, name=None
    )
    
`images` is a tensor of at least 3 dimensions. The last dimension is
interpreted as channels, and must be three.

The input image is considered in the RGB colorspace. Conceptually, the RGB
colors are first mapped into HSV. A delta is then applied all the hue values,
and then remapped back to RGB colorspace.

Args  
---  
`images` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`. Images to adjust. At least 3-D.   
`delta` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. A float delta to add to the hue.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `images`.
