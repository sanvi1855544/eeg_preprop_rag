`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppressionV5`

    
    tf.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppressionV5(
        boxes, scores, max_output_size, iou_threshold, score_threshold, soft_nms_sigma,
        pad_to_max_output_size=False, name=None
    )
    
pruning away boxes that have high intersection-over-union (IOU) overlap with
previously selected boxes. Bounding boxes with score less than
`score_threshold` are removed. Bounding boxes are supplied as [y1, x1, y2,
x2], where (y1, x1) and (y2, x2) are the coordinates of any diagonal pair of
box corners and the coordinates can be provided as normalized (i.e., lying in
the interval [0, 1]) or absolute. Note that this algorithm is agnostic to
where the origin is in the coordinate system and more generally is invariant
to orthogonal transformations and translations of the coordinate system; thus
translating or reflections of the coordinate system result in the same boxes
being selected by the algorithm. The output of this operation is a set of
integers indexing into the input collection of bounding boxes representing the
selected boxes. The bounding box coordinates corresponding to the selected
indices can then be obtained using the `tf.gather operation`. For example:
selected_indices = tf.image.non_max_suppression_v2( boxes, scores,
max_output_size, iou_threshold, score_threshold) selected_boxes =
tf.gather(boxes, selected_indices) This op also supports a Soft-NMS (with
Gaussian weighting) mode (c.f. Bodla et al, https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04503)
where boxes reduce the score of other overlapping boxes instead of directly
causing them to be pruned. To enable this Soft-NMS mode, set the
`soft_nms_sigma` parameter to be larger than 0.

Args  
---  
`boxes` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`. A 2-D float tensor of shape `[num_boxes, 4]`.   
`scores` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `boxes`. A 1-D float tensor of shape `[num_boxes]` representing a single score corresponding to each box (each row of boxes).   
`max_output_size` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. A scalar integer tensor representing the maximum number of boxes to be selected by non max suppression.   
`iou_threshold` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `boxes`. A 0-D float tensor representing the threshold for deciding whether boxes overlap too much with respect to IOU.   
`score_threshold` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `boxes`. A 0-D float tensor representing the threshold for deciding when to remove boxes based on score.   
`soft_nms_sigma` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `boxes`. A 0-D float tensor representing the sigma parameter for Soft NMS; see Bodla et al (c.f. https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04503). When `soft_nms_sigma=0.0` (which is default), we fall back to standard (hard) NMS.   
`pad_to_max_output_size` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If true, the output `selected_indices` is padded to be of length `max_output_size`. Defaults to false.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (selected_indices, selected_scores,
valid_outputs).  
`selected_indices` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`.   
`selected_scores` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `boxes`.   
`valid_outputs` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`.
