`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.IRFFT`

    
    tf.raw_ops.IRFFT(
        input, fft_length, Treal=tf.dtypes.float32, name=None
    )
    
Computes the inverse 1-dimensional discrete Fourier transform of a real-valued
signal over the inner-most dimension of `input`.

The inner-most dimension of `input` is assumed to be the result of `RFFT`: the
`fft_length / 2 + 1` unique components of the DFT of a real-valued signal. If
`fft_length` is not provided, it is computed from the size of the inner-most
dimension of `input` (`fft_length = 2 * (inner - 1)`). If the FFT length used
to compute `input` is odd, it should be provided since it cannot be inferred
properly.

Along the axis `IRFFT` is computed on, if `fft_length / 2 + 1` is smaller than
the corresponding dimension of `input`, the dimension is cropped. If it is
larger, the dimension is padded with zeros.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `complex64`, `complex128`. A complex tensor.   
`fft_length` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. An int32 tensor of shape [1]. The FFT length.   
`Treal` |  An optional `tf.DType` from: `tf.float32, tf.float64`. Defaults to `tf.float32`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `Treal`.
