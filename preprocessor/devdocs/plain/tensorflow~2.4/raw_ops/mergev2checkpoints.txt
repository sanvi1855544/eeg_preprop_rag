`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.MergeV2Checkpoints`

    
    tf.raw_ops.MergeV2Checkpoints(
        checkpoint_prefixes, destination_prefix, delete_old_dirs=True, name=None
    )
    
result is one logical checkpoint, with one physical metadata file and renamed
data files.

Intended for "grouping" multiple checkpoints in a sharded checkpoint setup.

If delete_old_dirs is true, attempts to delete recursively the dirname of each
path in the input checkpoint_prefixes. This is useful when those paths are non
user-facing temporary locations.

Args  
---  
`checkpoint_prefixes` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. prefixes of V2 checkpoints to merge.   
`destination_prefix` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. scalar. The desired final prefix. Allowed to be the same as one of the checkpoint_prefixes.   
`delete_old_dirs` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`. see above.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns
