`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.TensorScatterUpdate`

    
    tf.raw_ops.TensorScatterUpdate(
        tensor, indices, updates, name=None
    )
    
This operation creates a new tensor by applying sparse `updates` to the passed
in `tensor`. This operation is very similar to `tf.scatter_nd`, except that
the updates are scattered onto an existing tensor (as opposed to a zero-
tensor). If the memory for the existing tensor cannot be re-used, a copy is
made and updated.

If `indices` contains duplicates, then we pick the last update for the index.

If an out of bound index is found on CPU, an error is returned.

Warning: There are some GPU specific semantics for this operation.

  * If an out of bound index is found, the index is ignored.
  * The order in which updates are applied is nondeterministic, so the output will be nondeterministic if `indices` contains duplicates.

`indices` is an integer tensor containing indices into a new tensor of shape
`shape`.

  * `indices` must have at least 2 axes: `(num_updates, index_depth)`.
  * The last axis of `indices` is how deep to index into `tensor` so this index depth must be less than the rank of `tensor`: `indices.shape[-1] <= tensor.ndim`

if `indices.shape[-1] = tensor.rank` this Op indexes and updates scalar
elements. if `indices.shape[-1] < tensor.rank` it indexes and updates slices
of the input `tensor`.

Each `update` has a rank of `tensor.rank - indices.shape[-1]`. The overall
shape of `updates` is:

    
    indices.shape[:-1] + tensor.shape[indices.shape[-1]:]
    
For usage examples see the python tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update function

Args  
---  
`tensor` |  A `Tensor`. Tensor to copy/update.   
`indices` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. Index tensor.   
`updates` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `tensor`. Updates to scatter into output.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `tensor`.
