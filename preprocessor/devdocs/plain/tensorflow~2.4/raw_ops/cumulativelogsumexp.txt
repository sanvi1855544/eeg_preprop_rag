`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.CumulativeLogsumexp`

    
    tf.raw_ops.CumulativeLogsumexp(
        x, axis, exclusive=False, reverse=False, name=None
    )
    
By default, this op performs an inclusive cumulative log-sum-exp, which means
that the first element of the input is identical to the first element of the
output:

    
    tf.math.cumulative_logsumexp([a, b, c])  # => [a, log(exp(a) + exp(b)), log(exp(a) + exp(b) + exp(c))]
    
By setting the `exclusive` kwarg to `True`, an exclusive cumulative log-sum-
exp is performed instead:

    
    tf.cumulative_logsumexp([a, b, c], exclusive=True)  # => [-inf, a, log(exp(a) * exp(b))]
    
Note that the neutral element of the log-sum-exp operation is `-inf`, however,
for performance reasons, the minimal value representable by the floating point
type is used instead.

By setting the `reverse` kwarg to `True`, the cumulative log-sum-exp is
performed in the opposite direction.

Args  
---  
`x` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`, `float64`. A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float16`, `float32`, `float64`.   
`axis` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. A `Tensor` of type `int32` (default: 0). Must be in the range `[-rank(x), rank(x))`.   
`exclusive` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If `True`, perform exclusive cumulative log-sum-exp.   
`reverse` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. A `bool` (default: False).   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.
