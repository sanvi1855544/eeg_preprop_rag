`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor`

    
    tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor(
        shape, values, default_value, row_partition_tensors, row_partition_types,
        name=None
    )
    
The `ragged_to_dense` op creates a dense tensor from a list of row partition
tensors, a value vector, and default values. If the shape is unspecified, the
minimal shape required to contain all the elements in the ragged tensor (the
natural shape) will be used. If some dimensions are left unspecified, then the
size of the natural shape is used in that dimension.

The default_value will be broadcast to the output shape. After that, the
values from the ragged tensor overwrite the default values. Note that the
default_value must have less dimensions than the value.

The row partition tensors are in the order of the dimensions. At present, the
types can be:

  * "ROW_SPLITS": the row_splits tensor from the ragged tensor.
  * "VALUE_ROWIDS": the value_rowids tensor from the ragged tensor.
  * "FIRST_DIM_SIZE": if value_rowids is used for the first dimension, then it is preceded by "FIRST_DIM_SIZE".

Args  
---  
`shape` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int64`, `int32`. The desired shape of the the output tensor. If left unspecified (empty), the minimal shape required to contain all the elements in the ragged tensor (the natural shape) will be used. If some dimensions are left unspecified, then the size of the natural shape is used in that dimension. Note that dense dimensions cannot be modified by the shape argument. Trying to change the size of a dense dimension will cause the op to fail. Examples: natural shape: [4, 5, 6] shape: -1 output shape: [4, 5, 6] natural shape: [4, 5, 6] shape: [3, -1, 2] output shape: [3, 5, 2] natural shape: [4, 5, 6] shape: [3, 7, 2] output shape: [3, 7, 2]   
`values` |  A `Tensor`. A 1D tensor representing the values of the ragged tensor.   
`default_value` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `values`. The default_value when the shape is larger than the ragged tensor. The default_value is broadcast until it is the shape of the output tensor, and then overwritten by values in the ragged tensor. The default value must be compatible with this broadcast operation, and must have fewer dimensions than the value tensor.   
`row_partition_tensors` |  A list of at least 1 `Tensor` objects with the same type in: `int64`, `int32`.   
`row_partition_types` |  A list of `strings`. The types of the row partition tensors. At present, these can be: 
  * "ROW_SPLITS": the row_splits tensor from the ragged tensor.
  * "VALUE_ROWIDS": the value_rowids tensor from the ragged tensor.
  * "FIRST_DIM_SIZE": if value_rowids is used for the first dimension, then it is preceeded by "FIRST_DIM_SIZE". The tensors are in the order of the dimensions. 

  
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `values`.
