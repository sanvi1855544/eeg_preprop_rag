`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.ExperimentalMapAndBatchDataset`

    
    tf.raw_ops.ExperimentalMapAndBatchDataset(
        input_dataset, other_arguments, batch_size, num_parallel_calls, drop_remainder,
        f, output_types, output_shapes, preserve_cardinality=False, name=None
    )
    
Creates a dataset that applies `f` to the outputs of `input_dataset` and then
batches `batch_size` of them.

Unlike a "MapDataset", which applies `f` sequentially, this dataset invokes up
to `batch_size * num_parallel_batches` copies of `f` in parallel.

Args  
---  
`input_dataset` |  A `Tensor` of type `variant`. A variant tensor representing the input dataset.   
`other_arguments` |  A list of `Tensor` objects. A list of tensors, typically values that were captured when building a closure for `f`.   
`batch_size` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. A scalar representing the number of elements to accumulate in a batch. It determines the number of concurrent invocations of `f` that process elements from `input_dataset` in parallel.   
`num_parallel_calls` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. A scalar representing the maximum number of parallel invocations of the `map_fn` function. Applying the `map_fn` on consecutive input elements in parallel has the potential to improve input pipeline throughput.   
`drop_remainder` |  A `Tensor` of type `bool`. A scalar representing whether the last batch should be dropped in case its size is smaller than desired.   
`f` |  A function decorated with @Defun. A function to apply to the outputs of `input_dataset`.   
`output_types` |  A list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`.   
`output_shapes` |  A list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`) that has length `>= 1`.   
`preserve_cardinality` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `variant`.
