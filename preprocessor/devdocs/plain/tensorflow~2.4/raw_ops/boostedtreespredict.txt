`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.BoostedTreesPredict`

    
    tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesPredict(
        tree_ensemble_handle, bucketized_features, logits_dimension, name=None
    )
    
computes the logits. It is designed to be used during prediction. It traverses
all the trees and calculates the final score for each instance.

Args  
---  
`tree_ensemble_handle` |  A `Tensor` of type `resource`.   
`bucketized_features` |  A list of at least 1 `Tensor` objects with type `int32`. A list of rank 1 Tensors containing bucket id for each feature.   
`logits_dimension` |  An `int`. scalar, dimension of the logits, to be used for partial logits shape.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `float32`.
