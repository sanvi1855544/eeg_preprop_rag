`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.PrelinearizeTuple`

    
    tf.raw_ops.PrelinearizeTuple(
        inputs, shapes, layouts=[], name=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`inputs` |  A list of `Tensor` objects. A list of tensors that will be provided using the infeed mechanism.   
`shapes` |  A list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`). The shapes of each tensor in `inputs`.   
`layouts` |  An optional list of `ints`. Defaults to `[]`. A vector holding the requested layout in minor-to-major sequence for all the tuple shapes in the order the shapes appear in the "shapes" input. The layout elements for a sub-shape can be set to -1 in which case the corresponding layout will be computed by the infeed operation.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `variant`.
