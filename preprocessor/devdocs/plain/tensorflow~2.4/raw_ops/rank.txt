`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Rank`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Rank(
        input, name=None
    )
    
This operation returns an integer representing the rank of `input`.

#### For example:

    
    # 't' is [[[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]], [[3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4]]]
    # shape of tensor 't' is [2, 2, 3]
    rank(t) ==> 3
    
> Note: The rank of a tensor is not the same as the rank of a matrix. The rank
> of a tensor is the number of indices required to uniquely select each
> element of the tensor. Rank is also known as "order", "degree", or "ndims."
