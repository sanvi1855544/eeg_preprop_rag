`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Unpack`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Unpack(
        value, num, axis=0, name=None
    )
    
Unpacks `num` tensors from `value` by chipping it along the `axis` dimension.
For example, given a tensor of shape `(A, B, C, D)`;

If `axis == 0` then the i'th tensor in `output` is the slice `value[i, :, :,
:]` and each tensor in `output` will have shape `(B, C, D)`. (Note that the
dimension unpacked along is gone, unlike `split`).

If `axis == 1` then the i'th tensor in `output` is the slice `value[:, i, :,
:]` and each tensor in `output` will have shape `(A, C, D)`. Etc.

This is the opposite of `pack`.

Args  
---  
`value` |  A `Tensor`. 1-D or higher, with `axis` dimension size equal to `num`.   
`num` |  An `int` that is `>= 0`.   
`axis` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. Dimension along which to unpack. Negative values wrap around, so the valid range is `[-R, R)`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A list of `num` `Tensor` objects with the same type as `value`.
