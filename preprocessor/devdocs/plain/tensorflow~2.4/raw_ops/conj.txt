    tf.raw_ops.Conj(
        input, name=None
    )
    
Given a tensor `input` of complex numbers, this operation returns a tensor of
complex numbers that are the complex conjugate of each element in `input`. The
complex numbers in `input` must be of the form \\(a + bj\\), where a is the
real part and b is the imaginary part.

The complex conjugate returned by this operation is of the form \\(a - bj\\).

#### For example:

    
    # tensor 'input' is [-2.25 + 4.75j, 3.25 + 5.75j]
    tf.conj(input) ==> [-2.25 - 4.75j, 3.25 - 5.75j]
    
Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `complex64`, `complex128`, `variant`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
