    tf.raw_ops.NcclBroadcast(
        input, shape, name=None
    )
    
Sends `input` to all devices that are connected to the output.

The graph should be constructed so that all ops connected to the output have a
valid device assignment, and the op itself is assigned one of these devices.

input: The input to the broadcast. output: The same as input. shape: The shape
of the input tensor.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `int64`.   
`shape` |  A `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
