    tf.raw_ops.ResourceScatterNdMax(
        ref, indices, updates, use_locking=True, name=None
    )
    
| Args  
---  
`ref` |  A `Tensor` of type `resource`. A resource handle. Must be from a VarHandleOp.   
`indices` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. A tensor of indices into ref.   
`updates` |  A `Tensor`. A Tensor. Must have the same type as ref. A tensor of values whose element wise max is taken with ref   
`use_locking` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`. An optional bool. Defaults to True. If True, the assignment will be protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).
