`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.StatelessCase`

    
    tf.raw_ops.StatelessCase(
        branch_index, input, Tout, branches, output_shapes=[], name=None
    )
    
    
    An n-way switch statement, implementing the following:
    
    ```
    switch (branch_index) {
      case 0:
        output = branches[0](input);
        break;
      case 1:
        output = branches[1](input);
        break;
      ...
      case [[nbranches-1]]:
      default:
        output = branches[nbranches-1](input);
        break;
    }
    ```
    
    This should only be used when the none of branches has stateful ops.
    
Args  
---  
`branch_index` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. The branch selector, an int32 Tensor.   
`input` |  A list of `Tensor` objects. A list of input tensors passed to the branch function.   
`Tout` |  A list of `tf.DTypes`. A list of output types.   
`branches` |  A list of functions decorated with @Defun that has length `>= 1`. A list of functions each of which takes 'inputs' and returns a list of tensors, whose types are the same as what every other branch returns.   
`output_shapes` |  An optional list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`). Defaults to `[]`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A list of `Tensor` objects of type `Tout`.
