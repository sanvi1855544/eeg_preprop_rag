`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.QueueCloseV2`

    
    tf.raw_ops.QueueCloseV2(
        handle, cancel_pending_enqueues=False, name=None
    )
    
This operation signals that no more elements will be enqueued in the given
queue. Subsequent Enqueue(Many) operations will fail. Subsequent Dequeue(Many)
operations will continue to succeed if sufficient elements remain in the
queue. Subsequent Dequeue(Many) operations that would block will fail
immediately.

`cancel_pending_enqueues` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If true, all pending enqueue requests that are blocked on the given queue will be canceled.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns
