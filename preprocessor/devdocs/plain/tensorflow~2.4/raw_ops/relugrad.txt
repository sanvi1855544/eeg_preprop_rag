    tf.raw_ops.ReluGrad(
        gradients, features, name=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`gradients` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `uint8`, `int16`, `int8`, `int64`, `bfloat16`, `uint16`, `half`, `uint32`, `uint64`. The backpropagated gradients to the corresponding Relu operation.   
`features` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `gradients`. The features passed as input to the corresponding Relu operation, OR the outputs of that operation (both work equivalently).   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `gradients`.
