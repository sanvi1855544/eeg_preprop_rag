    tf.raw_ops.BatchMatMul(
        x, y, adj_x=False, adj_y=False, name=None
    )
    
Multiplies all slices of `Tensor` `x` and `y` (each slice can be viewed as an
element of a batch), and arranges the individual results in a single output
tensor of the same batch size. Each of the individual slices can optionally be
adjointed (to adjoint a matrix means to transpose and conjugate it) before
multiplication by setting the `adj_x` or `adj_y` flag to `True`, which are by
default `False`.

The input tensors `x` and `y` are 2-D or higher with shape `[..., r_x, c_x]`
and `[..., r_y, c_y]`.

The output tensor is 2-D or higher with shape `[..., r_o, c_o]`, where:

    
    r_o = c_x if adj_x else r_x
    c_o = r_y if adj_y else c_y
    
#### It is computed as:

output[..., :, :] = matrix(x[..., :, :]) * matrix(y[..., :, :])

Args  
---  
`x` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `bfloat16`, `half`, `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `int64`, `complex64`, `complex128`. 2-D or higher with shape `[..., r_x, c_x]`.   
`y` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. 2-D or higher with shape `[..., r_y, c_y]`.   
`adj_x` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If `True`, adjoint the slices of `x`. Defaults to `False`.   
`adj_y` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If `True`, adjoint the slices of `y`. Defaults to `False`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.
