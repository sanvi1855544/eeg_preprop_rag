    tf.raw_ops.MatrixSetDiag(
        input, diagonal, name=None
    )
    
Given `input` and `diagonal`, this operation returns a tensor with the same
shape and values as `input`, except for the main diagonal of the innermost
matrices. These will be overwritten by the values in `diagonal`.

The output is computed as follows:

Assume `input` has `k+1` dimensions `[I, J, K, ..., M, N]` and `diagonal` has
`k` dimensions `[I, J, K, ..., min(M, N)]`. Then the output is a tensor of
rank `k+1` with dimensions `[I, J, K, ..., M, N]` where:

  * `output[i, j, k, ..., m, n] = diagonal[i, j, k, ..., n]` for `m == n`.
  * `output[i, j, k, ..., m, n] = input[i, j, k, ..., m, n]` for `m != n`.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Rank `k+1`, where `k >= 1`.   
`diagonal` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `input`. Rank `k`, where `k >= 1`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
