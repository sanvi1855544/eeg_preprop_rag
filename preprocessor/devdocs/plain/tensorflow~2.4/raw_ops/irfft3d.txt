`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.IRFFT3D`

    
    tf.raw_ops.IRFFT3D(
        input, fft_length, Treal=tf.dtypes.float32, name=None
    )
    
Computes the inverse 3-dimensional discrete Fourier transform of a real-valued
signal over the inner-most 3 dimensions of `input`.

The inner-most 3 dimensions of `input` are assumed to be the result of
`RFFT3D`: The inner-most dimension contains the `fft_length / 2 + 1` unique
components of the DFT of a real-valued signal. If `fft_length` is not
provided, it is computed from the size of the inner-most 3 dimensions of
`input`. If the FFT length used to compute `input` is odd, it should be
provided since it cannot be inferred properly.

Along each axis `IRFFT3D` is computed on, if `fft_length` (or `fft_length / 2
+ 1` for the inner-most dimension) is smaller than the corresponding dimension
of `input`, the dimension is cropped. If it is larger, the dimension is padded
with zeros.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `complex64`, `complex128`. A complex tensor.   
`fft_length` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. An int32 tensor of shape [3]. The FFT length for each dimension.   
`Treal` |  An optional `tf.DType` from: `tf.float32, tf.float64`. Defaults to `tf.float32`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `Treal`.
