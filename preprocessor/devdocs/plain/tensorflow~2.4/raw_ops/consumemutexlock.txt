`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.ConsumeMutexLock`

    
    tf.raw_ops.ConsumeMutexLock(
        mutex_lock, name=None
    )
    
This op exists to consume a tensor created by `MutexLock` (other than direct
control dependencies). It should be the only that consumes the tensor, and
will raise an error if it is not. Its only purpose is to keep the mutex lock
tensor alive until it is consumed by this op.

> Note: This operation must run on the same device as its input. This may be
> enforced via the `colocate_with` mechanism.
