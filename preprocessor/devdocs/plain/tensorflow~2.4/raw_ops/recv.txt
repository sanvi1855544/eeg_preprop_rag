`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Recv`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Recv(
        tensor_type, tensor_name, send_device, send_device_incarnation, recv_device,
        client_terminated=False, name=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`tensor_type` |  A `tf.DType`.   
`tensor_name` |  A `string`. The name of the tensor to receive.   
`send_device` |  A `string`. The name of the device sending the tensor.   
`send_device_incarnation` |  An `int`. The current incarnation of send_device.   
`recv_device` |  A `string`. The name of the device receiving the tensor.   
`client_terminated` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If set to true, this indicates that the node was added to the graph as a result of a client-side feed or fetch of Tensor data, in which case the corresponding send or recv is expected to be managed locally by the caller.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `tensor_type`.
