`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.BoostedTreesQuantileStreamResourceGetBucketBoundaries`

    
    tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesQuantileStreamResourceGetBucketBoundaries(
        quantile_stream_resource_handle, num_features, name=None
    )
    
An op that returns a list of float tensors for a quantile stream resource.
Each tensor is Rank 1 containing bucket boundaries for a single feature.

Args  
---  
`quantile_stream_resource_handle` |  A `Tensor` of type `resource`. resource handle referring to a QuantileStreamResource.   
`num_features` |  An `int` that is `>= 0`. inferred int; number of features to get bucket boundaries for.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A list of `num_features` `Tensor` objects with type `float32`.
