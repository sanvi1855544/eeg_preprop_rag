`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.ParameterizedTruncatedNormal`

    
    tf.raw_ops.ParameterizedTruncatedNormal(
        shape, means, stdevs, minvals, maxvals, seed=0, seed2=0, name=None
    )
    
scalar which applies to the entire output, or a vector of length shape[0]
which stores the parameters for each batch.

Args  
---  
`shape` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. The shape of the output tensor. Batches are indexed by the 0th dimension.   
`means` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `bfloat16`, `float32`, `float64`. The mean parameter of each batch.   
`stdevs` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `means`. The standard deviation parameter of each batch. Must be greater than 0.   
`minvals` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `means`. The minimum cutoff. May be -infinity.   
`maxvals` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `means`. The maximum cutoff. May be +infinity, and must be more than the minval for each batch.   
`seed` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. If either `seed` or `seed2` are set to be non-zero, the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, it is seeded by a random seed.   
`seed2` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. A second seed to avoid seed collision.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `means`.
