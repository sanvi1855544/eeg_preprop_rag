`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Complex`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Complex(
        real, imag, Tout=tf.dtypes.complex64, name=None
    )
    
Given a tensor `real` representing the real part of a complex number, and a
tensor `imag` representing the imaginary part of a complex number, this
operation returns complex numbers elementwise of the form \\(a + bj\\), where
a represents the `real` part and b represents the `imag` part.

The input tensors `real` and `imag` must have the same shape.

#### For example:

    
    # tensor 'real' is [2.25, 3.25]
    # tensor `imag` is [4.75, 5.75]
    tf.complex(real, imag) ==> [[2.25 + 4.75j], [3.25 + 5.75j]]
    
Args  
---  
`real` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`.   
`imag` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `real`.   
`Tout` |  An optional `tf.DType` from: `tf.complex64, tf.complex128`. Defaults to `tf.complex64`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `Tout`.
