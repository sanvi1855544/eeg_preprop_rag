`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.NcclAllReduce`

    
    tf.raw_ops.NcclAllReduce(
        input, reduction, num_devices, shared_name, name=None
    )
    
Outputs a tensor containing the reduction across all input tensors passed to
ops within the same `shared_name.

The graph should be constructed so if one op runs with shared_name value `c`,
then `num_devices` ops will run with shared_name value `c`. Failure to do so
will cause the graph execution to fail to complete.

input: the input to the reduction data: the value of the reduction across all
`num_devices` devices. reduction: the reduction operation to perform.
num_devices: The number of devices participating in this reduction.
shared_name: Identifier that shared between ops of the same reduction.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `int64`.   
`reduction` |  A `string` from: `"min", "max", "prod", "sum"`.   
`num_devices` |  An `int`.   
`shared_name` |  A `string`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
