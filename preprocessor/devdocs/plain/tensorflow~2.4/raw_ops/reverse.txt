`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Reverse`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Reverse(
        tensor, dims, name=None
    )
    
Given a `tensor`, and a `bool` tensor `dims` representing the dimensions of
`tensor`, this operation reverses each dimension i of `tensor` where `dims[i]`
is `True`.

`tensor` can have up to 8 dimensions. The number of dimensions of `tensor`
must equal the number of elements in `dims`. In other words:

`rank(tensor) = size(dims)`

#### For example:

    
    # tensor 't' is [[[[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
    #                  [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
    #                  [ 8,  9, 10, 11]],
    #                 [[12, 13, 14, 15],
    #                  [16, 17, 18, 19],
    #                  [20, 21, 22, 23]]]]
    # tensor 't' shape is [1, 2, 3, 4]
    
    # 'dims' is [False, False, False, True]
    reverse(t, dims) ==> [[[[ 3,  2,  1,  0],
                            [ 7,  6,  5,  4],
                            [ 11, 10, 9, 8]],
                           [[15, 14, 13, 12],
                            [19, 18, 17, 16],
                            [23, 22, 21, 20]]]]
    
    # 'dims' is [False, True, False, False]
    reverse(t, dims) ==> [[[[12, 13, 14, 15],
                            [16, 17, 18, 19],
                            [20, 21, 22, 23]
                           [[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
                            [ 4,  5,  6,  7],
                            [ 8,  9, 10, 11]]]]
    
    # 'dims' is [False, False, True, False]
    reverse(t, dims) ==> [[[[8, 9, 10, 11],
                            [4, 5, 6, 7],
                            [0, 1, 2, 3]]
                           [[20, 21, 22, 23],
                            [16, 17, 18, 19],
                            [12, 13, 14, 15]]]]
