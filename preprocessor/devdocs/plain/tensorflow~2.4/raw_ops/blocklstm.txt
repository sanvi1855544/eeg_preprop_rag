`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.BlockLSTM`

    
    tf.raw_ops.BlockLSTM(
        seq_len_max, x, cs_prev, h_prev, w, wci, wcf, wco, b, forget_bias=1,
        cell_clip=3, use_peephole=False, name=None
    )
    
This is equivalent to applying LSTMBlockCell in a loop, like so:

    
    for x1 in unpack(x):
      i1, cs1, f1, o1, ci1, co1, h1 = LSTMBlock(
        x1, cs_prev, h_prev, w, wci, wcf, wco, b)
      cs_prev = cs1
      h_prev = h1
      i.append(i1)
      cs.append(cs1)
      f.append(f1)
      o.append(o1)
      ci.append(ci1)
      co.append(co1)
      h.append(h1)
    return pack(i), pack(cs), pack(f), pack(o), pack(ci), pack(ch), pack(h)
    
Args  
---  
`seq_len_max` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. Maximum time length actually used by this input. Outputs are padded with zeros beyond this length.   
`x` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`. The sequence input to the LSTM, shape (timelen, batch_size, num_inputs).   
`cs_prev` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. Value of the initial cell state.   
`h_prev` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. Initial output of cell (to be used for peephole).   
`w` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The weight matrix.   
`wci` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The weight matrix for input gate peephole connection.   
`wcf` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The weight matrix for forget gate peephole connection.   
`wco` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The weight matrix for output gate peephole connection.   
`b` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The bias vector.   
`forget_bias` |  An optional `float`. Defaults to `1`. The forget gate bias.   
`cell_clip` |  An optional `float`. Defaults to `3`. Value to clip the 'cs' value to.   
`use_peephole` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. Whether to use peephole weights.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (i, cs, f, o, ci, co, h).  
`i` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.   
`cs` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.   
`f` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.   
`o` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.   
`ci` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.   
`co` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.   
`h` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.
