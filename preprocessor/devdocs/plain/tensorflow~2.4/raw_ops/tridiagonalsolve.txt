`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.TridiagonalSolve`

    
    tf.raw_ops.TridiagonalSolve(
        diagonals, rhs, partial_pivoting=True, name=None
    )
    
Solves tridiagonal systems of equations. Supports batch dimensions and
multiple right-hand sides per each left-hand side. On CPU, solution is
computed via Gaussian elimination with or without partial pivoting, depending
on `partial_pivoting` attribute. On GPU, Nvidia's cuSPARSE library is used:
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusparse/index.html#gtsv Partial pivoting is not
yet supported by XLA backends.

Args  
---  
`diagonals` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float64`, `float32`, `complex64`, `complex128`. Tensor of shape `[..., 3, M]` whose innermost 2 dimensions represent the tridiagonal matrices with three rows being the superdiagonal, diagonals, and subdiagonals, in order. The last element of the superdiagonal and the first element of the subdiagonal is ignored.   
`rhs` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `diagonals`. Tensor of shape `[..., M, K]`, representing K right-hand sides per each left-hand side.   
`partial_pivoting` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`. Whether to apply partial pivoting. Partial pivoting makes the procedure more stable, but slower.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `diagonals`.
