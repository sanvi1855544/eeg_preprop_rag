    tf.raw_ops.Qr(
        input, full_matrices=False, name=None
    )
    
Computes the QR decomposition of each inner matrix in `tensor` such that
`tensor[..., :, :] = q[..., :, :] * r[..., :,:])`

Currently, the gradient for the QR decomposition is well-defined only when the
first `P` columns of the inner matrix are linearly independent, where `P` is
the minimum of `M` and `N`, the 2 inner-most dimmensions of `tensor`.

    
    # a is a tensor.
    # q is a tensor of orthonormal matrices.
    # r is a tensor of upper triangular matrices.
    q, r = qr(a)
    q_full, r_full = qr(a, full_matrices=True)
    
Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float64`, `float32`, `half`, `complex64`, `complex128`. A tensor of shape `[..., M, N]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions form matrices of size `[M, N]`. Let `P` be the minimum of `M` and `N`.   
`full_matrices` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If true, compute full-sized `q` and `r`. If false (the default), compute only the leading `P` columns of `q`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (q, r).  
`q` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.   
`r` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
