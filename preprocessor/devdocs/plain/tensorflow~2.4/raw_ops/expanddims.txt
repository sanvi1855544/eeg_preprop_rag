    tf.raw_ops.ExpandDims(
        input, axis, name=None
    )
    
Given a tensor `input`, this operation inserts a dimension of 1 at the
dimension index `axis` of `input`'s shape. The dimension index `axis` starts
at zero; if you specify a negative number for `axis` it is counted backward
from the end.

This operation is useful if you want to add a batch dimension to a single
element. For example, if you have a single image of shape `[height, width,
channels]`, you can make it a batch of 1 image with `expand_dims(image, 0)`,
which will make the shape `[1, height, width, channels]`.

#### Other examples:

    
    # 't' is a tensor of shape [2]
    shape(expand_dims(t, 0)) ==> [1, 2]
    shape(expand_dims(t, 1)) ==> [2, 1]
    shape(expand_dims(t, -1)) ==> [2, 1]
    
    # 't2' is a tensor of shape [2, 3, 5]
    shape(expand_dims(t2, 0)) ==> [1, 2, 3, 5]
    shape(expand_dims(t2, 2)) ==> [2, 3, 1, 5]
    shape(expand_dims(t2, 3)) ==> [2, 3, 5, 1]
    
This operation requires that:

`-1-input.dims() <= dim <= input.dims()`

This operation is related to `squeeze()`, which removes dimensions of size 1.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`.   
`axis` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. 0-D (scalar). Specifies the dimension index at which to expand the shape of `input`. Must be in the range `[-rank(input) - 1, rank(input)]`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
