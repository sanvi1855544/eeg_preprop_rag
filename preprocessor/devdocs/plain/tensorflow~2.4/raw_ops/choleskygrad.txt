Args  
---  
`l` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`, `float64`. Output of batch Cholesky algorithm l = cholesky(A). Shape is `[..., M, M]`. Algorithm depends only on lower triangular part of the innermost matrices of this tensor.   
`grad` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `l`. df/dl where f is some scalar function. Shape is `[..., M, M]`. Algorithm depends only on lower triangular part of the innermost matrices of this tensor.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `l`.
