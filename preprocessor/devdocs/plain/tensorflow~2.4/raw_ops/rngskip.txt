`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.RngSkip`

    
    tf.raw_ops.RngSkip(
        resource, algorithm, delta, name=None
    )
    
The state of the RNG after `rng_skip(n)` will be the same as that after
`stateful_uniform([n])` (or any other distribution). The actual increment
added to the counter is an unspecified implementation detail.

Args  
---  
`resource` |  A `Tensor` of type `resource`. The handle of the resource variable that stores the state of the RNG.   
`algorithm` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. The RNG algorithm.   
`delta` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. The amount of advancement.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The created Operation.
