        axis, value, num_split, name=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`axis` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. 0-D. The dimension along which to split. Must be in the range `[-rank(value), rank(value))`.   
`value` |  A `Tensor`. The tensor to split.   
`num_split` |  An `int` that is `>= 1`. The number of ways to split. Must evenly divide `value.shape[split_dim]`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---
