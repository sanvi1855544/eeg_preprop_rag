`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.RandomCrop`

    
    tf.raw_ops.RandomCrop(
        image, size, seed=0, seed2=0, name=None
    )
    
`size` is a 1-D int64 tensor with 2 elements representing the crop height and
width. The values must be non negative.

This Op picks a random location in `image` and crops a `height` by `width`
rectangle from that location. The random location is picked so the cropped
area will fit inside the original image.

Args  
---  
`image` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `uint8`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `float32`, `float64`. 3-D of shape `[height, width, channels]`.   
`size` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. 1-D of length 2 containing: `crop_height`, `crop_width`..   
`seed` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. If either seed or seed2 are set to be non-zero, the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, it is seeded by a random seed.   
`seed2` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. An second seed to avoid seed collision.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `image`.
