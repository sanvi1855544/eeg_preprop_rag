`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.ImageSummary`

    
    tf.raw_ops.ImageSummary(
        tag, tensor, max_images=3, bad_color=_execute.make_tensor(\n    'dtype:
        DT_UINT8 tensor_shape { dim { size: 4 } } int_val: 255 int_val: 0 int_val: 0
        int_val: 255'\n    , 'bad_color'), name=None
    )
    
The summary has up to `max_images` summary values containing images. The
images are built from `tensor` which must be 4-D with shape `[batch_size,
height, width, channels]` and where `channels` can be:

  * 1: `tensor` is interpreted as Grayscale.
  * 3: `tensor` is interpreted as RGB.
  * 4: `tensor` is interpreted as RGBA.

The images have the same number of channels as the input tensor. For float
input, the values are normalized one image at a time to fit in the range `[0,
255]`. `uint8` values are unchanged. The op uses two different normalization
algorithms:

  * If the input values are all positive, they are rescaled so the largest one is 255.
  * If any input value is negative, the values are shifted so input value 0.0 is at 127. They are then rescaled so that either the smallest value is 0, or the largest one is 255.

The `tag` argument is a scalar `Tensor` of type `string`. It is used to build
the `tag` of the summary values:

  * If `max_images` is 1, the summary value tag is 'tag/image'.
  * If `max_images` is greater than 1, the summary value tags are generated sequentially as 'tag/image/0', 'tag/image/1', etc.

The `bad_color` argument is the color to use in the generated images for non-
finite input values. It is a `uint8` 1-D tensor of length `channels`. Each
element must be in the range `[0, 255]` (It represents the value of a pixel in
the output image). Non-finite values in the input tensor are replaced by this
tensor in the output image. The default value is the color red.

Args  
---  
`tag` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. Scalar. Used to build the `tag` attribute of the summary values.   
`tensor` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `uint8`, `float32`, `half`, `float64`. 4-D of shape `[batch_size, height, width, channels]` where `channels` is 1, 3, or 4.   
`max_images` |  An optional `int` that is `>= 1`. Defaults to `3`. Max number of batch elements to generate images for.   
`bad_color` |  An optional `tf.TensorProto`. Defaults to `dtype: DT_UINT8 tensor_shape { dim { size: 4 } } int_val: 255 int_val: 0 int_val: 0 int_val: 255`. Color to use for pixels with non-finite values.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `string`.
