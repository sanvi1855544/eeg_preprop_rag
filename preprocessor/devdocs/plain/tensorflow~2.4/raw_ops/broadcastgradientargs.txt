`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.BroadcastGradientArgs`

    
    tf.raw_ops.BroadcastGradientArgs(
        s0, s1, name=None
    )
    
This is typically used by gradient computations for a broadcasting operation.

Args  
---  
`s0` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`.   
`s1` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `s0`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (r0, r1).  
`r0` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `s0`.   
`r1` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `s0`.
