    tf.raw_ops.Zeta(
        x, q, name=None
    )
    
The Hurwitz zeta function is defined as:

\\(\zeta(x, q) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (q + n)^{-x}\\)

`q` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.
