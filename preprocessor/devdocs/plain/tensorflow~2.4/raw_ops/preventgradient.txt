`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.PreventGradient`

    
    tf.raw_ops.PreventGradient(
        input, message='', name=None
    )
    
When executed in a graph, this op outputs its input tensor as-is.

When building ops to compute gradients, the TensorFlow gradient system will
return an error when trying to lookup the gradient of this op, because no
gradient must ever be registered for this function. This op exists to prevent
subtle bugs from silently returning unimplemented gradients in some corner
cases.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. any tensor.   
`message` |  An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`. Will be printed in the error when anyone tries to differentiate this operation.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
