`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.ResourceSparseApplyCenteredRMSProp`

    
    tf.raw_ops.ResourceSparseApplyCenteredRMSProp(
        var, mg, ms, mom, lr, rho, momentum, epsilon, grad, indices, use_locking=False,
        name=None
    )
    
The centered RMSProp algorithm uses an estimate of the centered second moment
(i.e., the variance) for normalization, as opposed to regular RMSProp, which
uses the (uncentered) second moment. This often helps with training, but is
slightly more expensive in terms of computation and memory.

Note that in dense implementation of this algorithm, mg, ms, and mom will
update even if the grad is zero, but in this sparse implementation, mg, ms,
and mom will not update in iterations during which the grad is zero.

mean_square = decay * mean_square + (1-decay) * gradient ** 2 mean_grad =
decay * mean_grad + (1-decay) * gradient Delta = learning_rate * gradient /
sqrt(mean_square + epsilon - mean_grad ** 2)

ms <\- rho * ms{t-1} + (1-rho) * grad * grad mom <\- momentum * mom{t-1} + lr
* grad / sqrt(ms + epsilon) var <\- var - mom

Args  
---  
`var` |  A `Tensor` of type `resource`. Should be from a Variable().   
`mg` |  A `Tensor` of type `resource`. Should be from a Variable().   
`ms` |  A `Tensor` of type `resource`. Should be from a Variable().   
`mom` |  A `Tensor` of type `resource`. Should be from a Variable().   
`lr` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `uint8`, `int16`, `int8`, `complex64`, `int64`, `qint8`, `quint8`, `qint32`, `bfloat16`, `uint16`, `complex128`, `half`, `uint32`, `uint64`. Scaling factor. Must be a scalar.   
`rho` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `lr`. Decay rate. Must be a scalar.   
`momentum` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `lr`.   
`epsilon` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `lr`. Ridge term. Must be a scalar.   
`grad` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `lr`. The gradient.   
`indices` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. A vector of indices into the first dimension of var, ms and mom.   
`use_locking` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If `True`, updating of the var, mg, ms, and mom tensors is protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The created Operation.
