`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.ApplyCenteredRMSProp`

    
    tf.raw_ops.ApplyCenteredRMSProp(
        var, mg, ms, mom, lr, rho, momentum, epsilon, grad, use_locking=False, name=None
    )
    
The centered RMSProp algorithm uses an estimate of the centered second moment
(i.e., the variance) for normalization, as opposed to regular RMSProp, which
uses the (uncentered) second moment. This often helps with training, but is
slightly more expensive in terms of computation and memory.

Note that in dense implementation of this algorithm, mg, ms, and mom will
update even if the grad is zero, but in this sparse implementation, mg, ms,
and mom will not update in iterations during which the grad is zero.

mean_square = decay * mean_square + (1-decay) * gradient ** 2 mean_grad =
decay * mean_grad + (1-decay) * gradient

Delta = learning_rate * gradient / sqrt(mean_square + epsilon - mean_grad **
2)

mg <\- rho * mg{t-1} + (1-rho) * grad ms <\- rho * ms{t-1} + (1-rho) * grad *
grad mom <\- momentum * mom_{t-1} + lr * grad / sqrt(ms - mg * mg + epsilon)
var <\- var - mom

Args  
---  
`var` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `uint8`, `int16`, `int8`, `complex64`, `int64`, `qint8`, `quint8`, `qint32`, `bfloat16`, `uint16`, `complex128`, `half`, `uint32`, `uint64`. Should be from a Variable().   
`mg` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Should be from a Variable().   
`ms` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Should be from a Variable().   
`mom` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Should be from a Variable().   
`lr` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Scaling factor. Must be a scalar.   
`rho` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Decay rate. Must be a scalar.   
`momentum` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Momentum Scale. Must be a scalar.   
`epsilon` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Ridge term. Must be a scalar.   
`grad` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. The gradient.   
`use_locking` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If `True`, updating of the var, mg, ms, and mom tensors is protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A mutable `Tensor`. Has the same type as `var`.
