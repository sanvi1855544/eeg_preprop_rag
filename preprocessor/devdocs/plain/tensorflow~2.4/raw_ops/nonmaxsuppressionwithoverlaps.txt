`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppressionWithOverlaps`

    
    tf.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppressionWithOverlaps(
        overlaps, scores, max_output_size, overlap_threshold, score_threshold, name=None
    )
    
pruning away boxes that have high overlaps with previously selected boxes.
Bounding boxes with score less than `score_threshold` are removed. N-by-n
overlap values are supplied as square matrix, which allows for defining a
custom overlap criterium (eg. intersection over union, intersection over area,
etc.).

The output of this operation is a set of integers indexing into the input
collection of bounding boxes representing the selected boxes. The bounding box
coordinates corresponding to the selected indices can then be obtained using
the `tf.gather operation`. For example:

selected_indices = tf.image.non_max_suppression_with_overlaps( overlaps,
scores, max_output_size, overlap_threshold, score_threshold) selected_boxes =
tf.gather(boxes, selected_indices)

Args  
---  
`overlaps` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. A 2-D float tensor of shape `[num_boxes, num_boxes]` representing the n-by-n box overlap values.   
`scores` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. A 1-D float tensor of shape `[num_boxes]` representing a single score corresponding to each box (each row of boxes).   
`max_output_size` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. A scalar integer tensor representing the maximum number of boxes to be selected by non max suppression.   
`overlap_threshold` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. A 0-D float tensor representing the threshold for deciding whether boxes overlap too.   
`score_threshold` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. A 0-D float tensor representing the threshold for deciding when to remove boxes based on score.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `int32`.
