`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Slice`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Slice(
        input, begin, size, name=None
    )
    
The output tensor is a tensor with dimensions described by 'size' whose values
are extracted from 'input' starting at the offsets in 'begin'.

Requirements: 0 <= begin[i] <= begin[i] + size[i] <= Di for i in [0, n)

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`.   
`begin` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. begin[i] specifies the offset into the 'i'th dimension of 'input' to slice from.   
`size` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `begin`. size[i] specifies the number of elements of the 'i'th dimension of 'input' to slice. If size[i] is -1, all remaining elements in dimension i are included in the slice (i.e. this is equivalent to setting size[i] = input.dim_size(i) - begin[i]).   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
