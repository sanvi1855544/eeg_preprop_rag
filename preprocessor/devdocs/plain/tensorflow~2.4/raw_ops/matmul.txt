`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.MatMul`

    
    tf.raw_ops.MatMul(
        a, b, transpose_a=False, transpose_b=False, name=None
    )
    
The inputs must be two-dimensional matrices and the inner dimension of "a"
(after being transposed if transpose_a is true) must match the outer dimension
of "b" (after being transposed if transposed_b is true).

> Note: The default kernel implementation for MatMul on GPUs uses cublas.
Args  
---  
`a` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `bfloat16`, `half`, `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `int64`, `complex64`, `complex128`.   
`b` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `a`.   
`transpose_a` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If true, "a" is transposed before multiplication.   
`transpose_b` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If true, "b" is transposed before multiplication.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `a`.
