`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.GRUBlockCell`

    
    tf.raw_ops.GRUBlockCell(
        x, h_prev, w_ru, w_c, b_ru, b_c, name=None
    )
    
Args x: Input to the GRU cell. h_prev: State input from the previous GRU cell.
w_ru: Weight matrix for the reset and update gate. w_c: Weight matrix for the
cell connection gate. b_ru: Bias vector for the reset and update gate. b_c:
Bias vector for the cell connection gate.

Returns r: Output of the reset gate. u: Output of the update gate. c: Output
of the cell connection gate. h: Current state of the GRU cell.

Note on notation of the variables:

Concatenation of a and b is represented by a_b Element-wise dot product of a
and b is represented by ab Element-wise dot product is represented by \circ
Matrix multiplication is represented by *

Biases are initialized with : `b_ru` \- constant_initializer(1.0) `b_c` \-
constant_initializer(0.0)

This kernel op implements the following mathematical equations:

    
    x_h_prev = [x, h_prev]
    
    [r_bar u_bar] = x_h_prev * w_ru + b_ru
    
    r = sigmoid(r_bar)
    u = sigmoid(u_bar)
    
    h_prevr = h_prev \circ r
    
    x_h_prevr = [x h_prevr]
    
    c_bar = x_h_prevr * w_c + b_c
    c = tanh(c_bar)
    
    h = (1-u) \circ c + u \circ h_prev
