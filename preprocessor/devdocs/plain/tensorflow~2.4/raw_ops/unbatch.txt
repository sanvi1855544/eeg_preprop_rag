`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Unbatch`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Unbatch(
        batched_tensor, batch_index, id, timeout_micros, container='',
        shared_name='', name=None
    )
    
An instance of Unbatch either receives an empty batched_tensor, in which case
it asynchronously waits until the values become available from a concurrently
running instance of Unbatch with the same container and shared_name, or
receives a non-empty batched_tensor in which case it finalizes all other
concurrently running instances and outputs its own element from the batch.

batched_tensor: The possibly transformed output of Batch. The size of the
first dimension should remain unchanged by the transformations for the
operation to work. batch_index: The matching batch_index obtained from Batch.
id: The id scalar emitted by Batch. unbatched_tensor: The Tensor corresponding
to this execution. timeout_micros: Maximum amount of time (in microseconds) to
wait to receive the batched input tensor associated with a given invocation of
the op. container: Container to control resource sharing. shared_name:
Instances of Unbatch with the same container and shared_name are assumed to
possibly belong to the same batch. If left empty, the op name will be used as
the shared name.
