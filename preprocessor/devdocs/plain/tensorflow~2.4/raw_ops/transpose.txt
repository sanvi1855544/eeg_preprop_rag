`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Transpose`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Transpose(
        x, perm, name=None
    )
    
The output `y` has the same rank as `x`. The shapes of `x` and `y` satisfy:
`y.shape[i] == x.shape[perm[i]] for i in [0, 1, ..., rank(x) - 1]`

Args  
---  
`x` |  A `Tensor`.   
`perm` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.
