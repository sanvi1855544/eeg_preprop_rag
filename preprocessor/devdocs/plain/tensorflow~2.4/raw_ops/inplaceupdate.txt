`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.InplaceUpdate`

    
    tf.raw_ops.InplaceUpdate(
        x, i, v, name=None
    )
    
Computes `x[i, :] = v; return x`.

Originally this function is mutative however for compilation we make this
operation create / operate on a copy of `x`.

Args  
---  
`x` |  A `Tensor`. A tensor of type `T`.   
`i` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. A vector. Indices into the left-most dimension of `x`.   
`v` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. A `Tensor` of type T. Same dimension sizes as x except the first dimension, which must be the same as i's size.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.
