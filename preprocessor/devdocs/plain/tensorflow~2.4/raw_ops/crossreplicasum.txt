`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.CrossReplicaSum`

    
    tf.raw_ops.CrossReplicaSum(
        input, group_assignment, name=None
    )
    
Each instance supplies its own input.

For example, suppose there are 8 TPU instances: `[A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H]`.
Passing group_assignment=`[[0,2,4,6],[1,3,5,7]]` sets `A, C, E, G` as group 0,
and `B, D, F, H` as group 1. Thus we get the outputs: `[A+C+E+G, B+D+F+H,
A+C+E+G, B+D+F+H, A+C+E+G, B+D+F+H, A+C+E+G, B+D+F+H]`.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `bfloat16`, `float32`, `int32`, `uint32`. The local input to the sum.   
`group_assignment` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. An int32 tensor with shape [num_groups, num_replicas_per_group]. `group_assignment[i]` represents the replica ids in the ith subgroup.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
