`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.TensorListSplit`

    
    tf.raw_ops.TensorListSplit(
        tensor, element_shape, lengths, name=None
    )
    
list[i] corresponds to lengths[i] tensors from the input tensor. The tensor
must have rank at least 1 and contain exactly sum(lengths) elements.

tensor: The input tensor. element_shape: A shape compatible with that of
elements in the tensor. lengths: Vector of sizes of the 0th dimension of
tensors in the list. output_handle: The list.

Args  
---  
`tensor` |  A `Tensor`.   
`element_shape` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`.   
`lengths` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `variant`.
