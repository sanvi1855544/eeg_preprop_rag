`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Range`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Range(
        start, limit, delta, name=None
    )
    
This operation creates a sequence of numbers that begins at `start` and
extends by increments of `delta` up to but not including `limit`.

#### For example:

    
    # 'start' is 3
    # 'limit' is 18
    # 'delta' is 3
    tf.range(start, limit, delta) ==> [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
    
Args  
---  
`start` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `bfloat16`, `half`, `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `int64`. 0-D (scalar). First entry in the sequence.   
`limit` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `start`. 0-D (scalar). Upper limit of sequence, exclusive.   
`delta` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `start`. 0-D (scalar). Optional. Default is 1. Number that increments `start`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `start`.
