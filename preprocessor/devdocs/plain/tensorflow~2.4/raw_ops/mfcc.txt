Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients are a way of representing audio data
that's been effective as an input feature for machine learning. They are
created by taking the spectrum of a spectrogram (a 'cepstrum'), and discarding
some of the higher frequencies that are less significant to the human ear.
They have a long history in the speech recognition world, and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum is a good resource to
learn more.

Args  
---  
`spectrogram` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. Typically produced by the Spectrogram op, with magnitude_squared set to true.   
`sample_rate` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. How many samples per second the source audio used.   
`upper_frequency_limit` |  An optional `float`. Defaults to `4000`. The highest frequency to use when calculating the ceptstrum.   
`lower_frequency_limit` |  An optional `float`. Defaults to `20`. The lowest frequency to use when calculating the ceptstrum.   
`filterbank_channel_count` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `40`. Resolution of the Mel bank used internally.   
`dct_coefficient_count` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `13`. How many output channels to produce per time slice.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `float32`.
