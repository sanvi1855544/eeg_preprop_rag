`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.RaggedBincount`

    
    tf.raw_ops.RaggedBincount(
        splits, values, size, weights, binary_output=False, name=None
    )
    
Outputs a vector with length `size` and the same dtype as `weights`. If
`weights` are empty, then index `i` stores the number of times the value `i`
is counted in `arr`. If `weights` are non-empty, then index `i` stores the sum
of the value in `weights` at each index where the corresponding value in `arr`
is `i`.

Values in `arr` outside of the range [0, size) are ignored.

Args  
---  
`splits` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. 1D int64 `Tensor`.   
`values` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. 2D int `Tensor`.   
`size` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `values`. non-negative int scalar `Tensor`.   
`weights` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`, `float32`, `float64`. is an int32, int64, float32, or float64 `Tensor` with the same shape as `input`, or a length-0 `Tensor`, in which case it acts as all weights equal to 1.   
`binary_output` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. bool; Whether the kernel should count the appearance or number of occurrences.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `weights`.
