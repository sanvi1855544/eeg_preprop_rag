`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.RestoreSlice`

    
    tf.raw_ops.RestoreSlice(
        file_pattern, tensor_name, shape_and_slice, dt, preferred_shard=-1, name=None
    )
    
This is like `Restore` except that restored tensor can be listed as filling
only a slice of a larger tensor. `shape_and_slice` specifies the shape of the
larger tensor and the slice that the restored tensor covers.

The `shape_and_slice` input has the same format as the elements of the
`shapes_and_slices` input of the `SaveSlices` op.

Args  
---  
`file_pattern` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. Must have a single element. The pattern of the files from which we read the tensor.   
`tensor_name` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. Must have a single element. The name of the tensor to be restored.   
`shape_and_slice` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. Scalar. The shapes and slice specifications to use when restoring a tensors.   
`dt` |  A `tf.DType`. The type of the tensor to be restored.   
`preferred_shard` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `-1`. Index of file to open first if multiple files match `file_pattern`. See the documentation for `Restore`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `dt`.
