`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Placeholder`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Placeholder(
        dtype, shape=None, name=None
    )
    
N.B. This operation will fail with an error if it is executed. It is intended
as a way to represent a value that will always be fed, and to provide attrs
that enable the fed value to be checked at runtime.

Args

`dtype` |  A `tf.DType`. The type of elements in the tensor.   
`shape` |  An optional `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`. Defaults to `None`. (Optional) The shape of the tensor. If the shape has 0 dimensions, the shape is unconstrained.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns
