`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.RefMerge`

    
    tf.raw_ops.RefMerge(
        inputs, name=None
    )
    
`Merge` waits for at least one of the tensors in `inputs` to become available.
It is usually combined with `Switch` to implement branching.

`Merge` forwards the first tensor for become available to `output`, and sets
`value_index` to its index in `inputs`.

Args  
---  
`inputs` |  A list of at least 1 mutable `Tensor` objects with the same type. The input tensors, exactly one of which will become available.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (output, value_index).  
`output` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Has the same type as `inputs`.   
`value_index` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`.
