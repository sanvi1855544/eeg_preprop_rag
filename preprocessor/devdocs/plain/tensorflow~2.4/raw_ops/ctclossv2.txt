`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.CTCLossV2`

    
    tf.raw_ops.CTCLossV2(
        inputs, labels_indices, labels_values, sequence_length,
        preprocess_collapse_repeated=False, ctc_merge_repeated=True,
        ignore_longer_outputs_than_inputs=False, name=None
    )
    
the gradient. This class performs the softmax operation for you, so inputs
should be e.g. linear projections of outputs by an LSTM.

Args  
---  
`inputs` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. 3-D, shape: `(max_time x batch_size x num_classes)`, the logits. Default blank label is 0 rather num_classes - 1.   
`labels_indices` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. The indices of a `SparseTensor<int32, 2>`. `labels_indices(i, :) == [b, t]` means `labels_values(i)` stores the id for `(batch b, time t)`.   
`labels_values` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. The values (labels) associated with the given batch and time.   
`sequence_length` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. A vector containing sequence lengths (batch).   
`preprocess_collapse_repeated` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. Scalar, if true then repeated labels are collapsed prior to the CTC calculation.   
`ctc_merge_repeated` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`. Scalar. If set to false, during CTC calculation repeated non-blank labels will not be merged and are interpreted as individual labels. This is a simplified version of CTC.   
`ignore_longer_outputs_than_inputs` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. Scalar. If set to true, during CTC calculation, items that have longer output sequences than input sequences are skipped: they don't contribute to the loss term and have zero-gradient.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (loss, gradient).  
`loss` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`.   
`gradient` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`.
