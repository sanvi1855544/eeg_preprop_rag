`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.PaddingFIFOQueue`

    
    tf.raw_ops.PaddingFIFOQueue(
        component_types, shapes=[], capacity=-1, container='',
        shared_name='', name=None
    )
    
Variable-size shapes are allowed by setting the corresponding shape dimensions
to 0 in the shape attr. In this case DequeueMany will pad up to the maximum
size of any given element in the minibatch. See below for details.

Args  
---  
`component_types` |  A list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`. The type of each component in a value.   
`shapes` |  An optional list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`). Defaults to `[]`. The shape of each component in a value. The length of this attr must be either 0 or the same as the length of component_types. Shapes of fixed rank but variable size are allowed by setting any shape dimension to -1. In this case, the inputs' shape may vary along the given dimension, and DequeueMany will pad the given dimension with zeros up to the maximum shape of all elements in the given batch. If the length of this attr is 0, different queue elements may have different ranks and shapes, but only one element may be dequeued at a time.   
`capacity` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `-1`. The upper bound on the number of elements in this queue. Negative numbers mean no limit.   
`container` |  An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`. If non-empty, this queue is placed in the given container. Otherwise, a default container is used.   
`shared_name` |  An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`. If non-empty, this queue will be shared under the given name across multiple sessions.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type mutable `string`.
