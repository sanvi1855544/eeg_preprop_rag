`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.TemporaryVariable`

    
    tf.raw_ops.TemporaryVariable(
        shape, dtype, var_name='', name=None
    )
    
This is an experimental op for internal use only and it is possible to use
this op in unsafe ways. DO NOT USE unless you fully understand the risks.

It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that 'ref' is eventually passed to
a matching 'DestroyTemporaryVariable' op after all other uses have completed.

Outputs a ref to the tensor state so it may be read or modified.

E.g. var = state_ops._temporaryvariable([1, 2], types.float) var_name =
var.op.name var = state_ops.assign(var, [[4.0, 5.0]]) var =
state_ops.assign_add(var, [[6.0, 7.0]]) final =
state_ops._destroy_temporary_variable(var, var_name=var_name)

Args  
---  
`shape` |  A `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`. The shape of the variable tensor.   
`dtype` |  A `tf.DType`. The type of elements in the variable tensor.   
`var_name` |  An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`. Overrides the name used for the temporary variable resource. Default value is the name of the 'TemporaryVariable' op (which is guaranteed unique).   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A mutable `Tensor` of type `dtype`.
