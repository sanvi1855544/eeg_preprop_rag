`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.All`

    
    tf.raw_ops.All(
        input, axis, keep_dims=False, name=None
    )
    
Reduces `input` along the dimensions given in `axis`. Unless `keep_dims` is
true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each entry in `axis`. If
`keep_dims` is true, the reduced dimensions are retained with length 1.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor` of type `bool`. The tensor to reduce.   
`axis` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. The dimensions to reduce. Must be in the range `[-rank(input), rank(input))`.   
`keep_dims` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If true, retain reduced dimensions with length 1.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `bool`.
