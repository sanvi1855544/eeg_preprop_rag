`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.DestroyTemporaryVariable`

    
    tf.raw_ops.DestroyTemporaryVariable(
        ref, var_name, name=None
    )
    
Sets output to the value of the Tensor pointed to by 'ref', then destroys the
temporary variable called 'var_name'. All other uses of 'ref' must have
executed before this op. This is typically achieved by chaining the ref
through each assign op, or by using control dependencies.

Outputs the final value of the tensor pointed to by 'ref'.

Args  
---  
`ref` |  A mutable `Tensor`. A reference to the temporary variable tensor.   
`var_name` |  A `string`. Name of the temporary variable, usually the name of the matching 'TemporaryVariable' op.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `ref`.
