`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.SaveV2`

    
    tf.raw_ops.SaveV2(
        prefix, tensor_names, shape_and_slices, tensors, name=None
    )
    
By default, saves the named tensors in full. If the caller wishes to save
specific slices of full tensors, "shape_and_slices" should be non-empty
strings and correspondingly well-formed.

Args  
---  
`prefix` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. Must have a single element. The prefix of the V2 checkpoint to which we write the tensors.   
`tensor_names` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. shape {N}. The names of the tensors to be saved.   
`shape_and_slices` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. shape {N}. The slice specs of the tensors to be saved. Empty strings indicate that they are non-partitioned tensors.   
`tensors` |  A list of `Tensor` objects. `N` tensors to save.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The created Operation.
