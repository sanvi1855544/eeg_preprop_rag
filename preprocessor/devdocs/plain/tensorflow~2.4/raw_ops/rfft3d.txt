`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.RFFT3D`

    
    tf.raw_ops.RFFT3D(
        input, fft_length, Tcomplex=tf.dtypes.complex64, name=None
    )
    
Computes the 3-dimensional discrete Fourier transform of a real-valued signal
over the inner-most 3 dimensions of `input`.

Since the DFT of a real signal is Hermitian-symmetric, `RFFT3D` only returns
the `fft_length / 2 + 1` unique components of the FFT for the inner-most
dimension of `output`: the zero-frequency term, followed by the `fft_length /
2` positive-frequency terms.

Along each axis `RFFT3D` is computed on, if `fft_length` is smaller than the
corresponding dimension of `input`, the dimension is cropped. If it is larger,
the dimension is padded with zeros.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`. A float32 tensor.   
`fft_length` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. An int32 tensor of shape [3]. The FFT length for each dimension.   
`Tcomplex` |  An optional `tf.DType` from: `tf.complex64, tf.complex128`. Defaults to `tf.complex64`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `Tcomplex`.
