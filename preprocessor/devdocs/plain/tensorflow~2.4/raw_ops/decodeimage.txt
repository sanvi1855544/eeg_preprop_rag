`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.DecodeImage`

    
    tf.raw_ops.DecodeImage(
        contents, channels=0, dtype=tf.dtypes.uint8, expand_animations=True, name=None
    )
    
Detects whether an image is a BMP, GIF, JPEG, or PNG, and performs the
appropriate operation to convert the input bytes string into a Tensor of type
dtype.

> Note: decode_gif returns a 4-D array [num_frames, height, width, 3], as
> opposed to decode_bmp, decode_jpeg and decode_png, which return 3-D arrays
> [height, width, num_channels]. Make sure to take this into account when
> constructing your graph if you are intermixing GIF files with BMP, JPEG,
> and/or PNG files. Alternately, set the expand_animations argument of this
> function to False, in which case the op will return 3-dimensional tensors
> and will truncate animated GIF files to the first frame.
> Note: If the first frame of an animated GIF does not occupy the entire
> canvas (maximum frame width x maximum frame height), then it fills the
> unoccupied areas (in the first frame) with zeros (black). For frames after
> the first frame that does not occupy the entire canvas, it uses the previous
> frame to fill the unoccupied areas.
Args  
---  
`contents` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. 0-D. The encoded image bytes.   
`channels` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. Number of color channels for the decoded image.   
`dtype` |  An optional `tf.DType` from: `tf.uint8, tf.uint16, tf.float32`. Defaults to `tf.uint8`. The desired DType of the returned Tensor.   
`expand_animations` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`. Controls the output shape of the returned op. If True, the returned op will produce a 3-D tensor for PNG, JPEG, and BMP files; and a 4-D tensor for all GIFs, whether animated or not. If, False, the returned op will produce a 3-D tensor for all file types and will truncate animated GIFs to the first frame.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `dtype`.
