    tf.raw_ops.TridiagonalMatMul(
        superdiag, maindiag, subdiag, rhs, name=None
    )
    
Calculates product of two matrices, where left matrix is a tridiagonal matrix.

Args  
---  
`superdiag` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float64`, `float32`, `complex64`, `complex128`. Tensor of shape `[..., 1, M]`, representing superdiagonals of tri-diagonal matrices to the left of multiplication. Last element is ignored.   
`maindiag` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `superdiag`. Tensor of shape `[..., 1, M]`, representing main diagonals of tri-diagonal matrices to the left of multiplication.   
`subdiag` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `superdiag`. Tensor of shape `[..., 1, M]`, representing subdiagonals of tri-diagonal matrices to the left of multiplication. First element is ignored.   
`rhs` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `superdiag`. Tensor of shape `[..., M, N]`, representing MxN matrices to the right of multiplication.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `superdiag`.
