`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Svd`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Svd(
        input, compute_uv=True, full_matrices=False, name=None
    )
    
Computes the SVD of each inner matrix in `input` such that `input[..., :, :] =
u[..., :, :] * diag(s[..., :, :]) * transpose(v[..., :, :])`

    
    # a is a tensor containing a batch of matrices.
    # s is a tensor of singular values for each matrix.
    # u is the tensor containing the left singular vectors for each matrix.
    # v is the tensor containing the right singular vectors for each matrix.
    s, u, v = svd(a)
    s, _, _ = svd(a, compute_uv=False)
    
Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float64`, `float32`, `half`, `complex64`, `complex128`. A tensor of shape `[..., M, N]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions form matrices of size `[M, N]`. Let `P` be the minimum of `M` and `N`.   
`compute_uv` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`. If true, left and right singular vectors will be computed and returned in `u` and `v`, respectively. If false, `u` and `v` are not set and should never referenced.   
`full_matrices` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If true, compute full-sized `u` and `v`. If false (the default), compute only the leading `P` singular vectors. Ignored if `compute_uv` is `False`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (s, u, v).  
`s` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.   
`u` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.   
`v` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
