`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.TruncateDiv`

    
    tf.raw_ops.TruncateDiv(
        x, y, name=None
    )
    
Truncation designates that negative numbers will round fractional quantities
toward zero. I.e. -7 / 5 = -1. This matches C semantics but it is different
than Python semantics. See `FloorDiv` for a division function that matches
Python Semantics.
