`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.ApplyAdaMax`

    
    tf.raw_ops.ApplyAdaMax(
        var, m, v, beta1_power, lr, beta1, beta2, epsilon, grad, use_locking=False,
        name=None
    )
    
mt <\- beta1 * m{t-1} + (1 - beta1) * g vt <\- max(beta2 * v{t-1}, abs(g))
variable <\- variable - learning_rate / (1 - beta1^t) * m_t / (v_t + epsilon)

Args  
---  
`var` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `uint8`, `int16`, `int8`, `complex64`, `int64`, `qint8`, `quint8`, `qint32`, `bfloat16`, `uint16`, `complex128`, `half`, `uint32`, `uint64`. Should be from a Variable().   
`m` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Should be from a Variable().   
`v` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Should be from a Variable().   
`beta1_power` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Must be a scalar.   
`lr` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Scaling factor. Must be a scalar.   
`beta1` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Momentum factor. Must be a scalar.   
`beta2` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Momentum factor. Must be a scalar.   
`epsilon` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Ridge term. Must be a scalar.   
`grad` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. The gradient.   
`use_locking` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If `True`, updating of the var, m, and v tensors will be protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A mutable `Tensor`. Has the same type as `var`.
