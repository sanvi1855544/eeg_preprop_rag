    tf.raw_ops.StatelessParameterizedTruncatedNormal(
        shape, seed, means, stddevs, minvals, maxvals, name=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`shape` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. The shape of the output tensor.   
`seed` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. 2 seeds (shape [2]).   
`means` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`, `float64`. The mean parameter of each batch.   
`stddevs` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `means`. The standard deviation parameter of each batch. Must be greater than 0.   
`minvals` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `means`. The minimum cutoff. May be -infinity.   
`maxvals` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `means`. The maximum cutoff. May be +infinity, and must be more than the minval for each batch.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `means`.
