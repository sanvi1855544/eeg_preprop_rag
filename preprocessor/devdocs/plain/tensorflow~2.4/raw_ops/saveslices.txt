`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.SaveSlices`

    
    tf.raw_ops.SaveSlices(
        filename, tensor_names, shapes_and_slices, data, name=None
    )
    
This is like `Save` except that tensors can be listed in the saved file as
being a slice of a larger tensor. `shapes_and_slices` specifies the shape of
the larger tensor and the slice that this tensor covers. `shapes_and_slices`
must have as many elements as `tensor_names`.

Elements of the `shapes_and_slices` input must either be:

  * The empty string, in which case the corresponding tensor is saved normally.
  * A string of the form `dim0 dim1 ... dimN-1 slice-spec` where the `dimI` are the dimensions of the larger tensor and `slice-spec` specifies what part is covered by the tensor to save.

`slice-spec` itself is a `:`-separated list: `slice0:slice1:...:sliceN-1`
where each `sliceI` is either:

  * The string `-` meaning that the slice covers all indices of this dimension
  * `start,length` where `start` and `length` are integers. In that case the slice covers `length` indices starting at `start`.

See also `Save`.

Args  
---  
`filename` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. Must have a single element. The name of the file to which we write the tensor.   
`tensor_names` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. Shape `[N]`. The names of the tensors to be saved.   
`shapes_and_slices` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. Shape `[N]`. The shapes and slice specifications to use when saving the tensors.   
`data` |  A list of `Tensor` objects. `N` tensors to save.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns
