`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.If`

    
    tf.raw_ops.If(
        cond, input, Tout, then_branch, else_branch, output_shapes=[], name=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`cond` |  A `Tensor`. A Tensor. If the tensor is a scalar of non-boolean type, the scalar is converted to a boolean according to the following rule: if the scalar is a numerical value, non-zero means `True` and zero means False; if the scalar is a string, non-empty means `True` and empty means `False`. If the tensor is not a scalar, being empty means False and being non-empty means True.   
`input` |  A list of `Tensor` objects. A list of input tensors.   
`Tout` |  A list of `tf.DTypes`. A list of output types.   
`then_branch` |  A function decorated with @Defun. A function that takes 'inputs' and returns a list of tensors, whose types are the same as what else_branch returns.   
`else_branch` |  A function decorated with @Defun. A function that takes 'inputs' and returns a list of tensors, whose types are the same as what then_branch returns.   
`output_shapes` |  An optional list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`). Defaults to `[]`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A list of `Tensor` objects of type `Tout`.
