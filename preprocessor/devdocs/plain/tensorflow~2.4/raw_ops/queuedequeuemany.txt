`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.QueueDequeueMany`

    
    tf.raw_ops.QueueDequeueMany(
        handle, n, component_types, timeout_ms=-1, name=None
    )
    
If the queue is closed and there are fewer than `n` elements, then an
OutOfRange error is returned.

This operation concatenates queue-element component tensors along the 0th
dimension to make a single component tensor. All of the components in the
dequeued tuple will have size `n` in the 0th dimension.

This operation has `k` outputs, where `k` is the number of components in the
tuples stored in the given queue, and output `i` is the ith component of the
dequeued tuple.

N.B. If the queue is empty, this operation will block until `n` elements have
been dequeued (or 'timeout_ms' elapses, if specified).

Args  
---  
`handle` |  A `Tensor` of type mutable `string`. The handle to a queue.   
`n` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. The number of tuples to dequeue.   
`component_types` |  A list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`. The type of each component in a tuple.   
`timeout_ms` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `-1`. If the queue has fewer than n elements, this operation will block for up to timeout_ms milliseconds. Note: This option is not supported yet.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A list of `Tensor` objects of type `component_types`.
