`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.QueueDequeue`

    
    tf.raw_ops.QueueDequeue(
        handle, component_types, timeout_ms=-1, name=None
    )
    
This operation has k outputs, where k is the number of components in the
tuples stored in the given queue, and output i is the ith component of the
dequeued tuple.

N.B. If the queue is empty, this operation will block until an element has
been dequeued (or 'timeout_ms' elapses, if specified).

Args  
---  
`handle` |  A `Tensor` of type mutable `string`. The handle to a queue.   
`component_types` |  A list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`. The type of each component in a tuple.   
`timeout_ms` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `-1`. If the queue is empty, this operation will block for up to timeout_ms milliseconds. Note: This option is not supported yet.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A list of `Tensor` objects of type `component_types`.
