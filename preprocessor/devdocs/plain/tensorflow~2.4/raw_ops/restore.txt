`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Restore`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Restore(
        file_pattern, tensor_name, dt, preferred_shard=-1, name=None
    )
    
Reads a tensor stored in one or several files. If there are several files (for
instance because a tensor was saved as slices), `file_pattern` may contain
wildcard symbols (`*` and `?`) in the filename portion only, not in the
directory portion.

If a `file_pattern` matches several files, `preferred_shard` can be used to
hint in which file the requested tensor is likely to be found. This op will
first open the file at index `preferred_shard` in the list of matching files
and try to restore tensors from that file. Only if some tensors or tensor
slices are not found in that first file, then the Op opens all the files.
Setting `preferred_shard` to match the value passed as the `shard` input of a
matching `Save` Op may speed up Restore. This attribute only affects
performance, not correctness. The default value -1 means files are processed
in order.

See also `RestoreSlice`.

Args  
---  
`file_pattern` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. Must have a single element. The pattern of the files from which we read the tensor.   
`tensor_name` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. Must have a single element. The name of the tensor to be restored.   
`dt` |  A `tf.DType`. The type of the tensor to be restored.   
`preferred_shard` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `-1`. Index of file to open first if multiple files match `file_pattern`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `dt`.
