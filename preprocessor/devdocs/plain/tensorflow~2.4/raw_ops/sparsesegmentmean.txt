`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.SparseSegmentMean`

    
    tf.raw_ops.SparseSegmentMean(
        data, indices, segment_ids, name=None
    )
    
See `tf.sparse.segment_sum` for usage examples.

Like `SegmentMean`, but `segment_ids` can have rank less than `data`'s first
dimension, selecting a subset of dimension 0, specified by `indices`.

Args  
---  
`data` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `bfloat16`, `float32`, `float64`.   
`indices` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. A 1-D tensor. Has same rank as `segment_ids`.   
`segment_ids` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. A 1-D tensor. Values should be sorted and can be repeated.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `data`.
