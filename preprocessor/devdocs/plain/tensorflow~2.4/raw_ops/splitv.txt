    tf.raw_ops.SplitV(
        value, size_splits, axis, num_split, name=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`value` |  A `Tensor`. The tensor to split.   
`size_splits` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. list containing the sizes of each output tensor along the split dimension. Must sum to the dimension of value along split_dim. Can contain one -1 indicating that dimension is to be inferred.   
`axis` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. 0-D. The dimension along which to split. Must be in the range `[-rank(value), rank(value))`.   
`num_split` |  An `int` that is `>= 1`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A list of `num_split` `Tensor` objects with the same type as `value`.
