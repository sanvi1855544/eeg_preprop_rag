`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.BarrierClose`

    
    tf.raw_ops.BarrierClose(
        handle, cancel_pending_enqueues=False, name=None
    )
    
This operation signals that no more new elements will be inserted in the given
barrier. Subsequent InsertMany that try to introduce a new key will fail.
Subsequent InsertMany operations that just add missing components to already
existing elements will continue to succeed. Subsequent TakeMany operations
will continue to succeed if sufficient completed elements remain in the
barrier. Subsequent TakeMany operations that would block will fail
immediately.

Args  
---  
`handle` |  A `Tensor` of type mutable `string`. The handle to a barrier.   
`cancel_pending_enqueues` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If true, all pending enqueue requests that are blocked on the barrier's queue will be canceled. InsertMany will fail, even if no new key is introduced.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns
