`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.SamplingDataset`

    
    tf.raw_ops.SamplingDataset(
        input_dataset, rate, seed, seed2, output_types, output_shapes, name=None
    )
    
There is no transformation in the `tf.data` Python API for creating this
dataset. Instead, it is created as a result of the
`filter_with_random_uniform_fusion` static optimization. Whether this
optimization is performed is determined by the
`experimental_optimization.filter_with_random_uniform_fusion` option of
`tf.data.Options`.

Args  
---  
`input_dataset` |  A `Tensor` of type `variant`.   
`rate` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. A scalar representing the sample rate. Each element of `input_dataset` is retained with this probability, independent of all other elements.   
`seed` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. A scalar representing seed of random number generator.   
`seed2` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. A scalar representing seed2 of random number generator.   
`output_types` |  A list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`.   
`output_shapes` |  A list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`) that has length `>= 1`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `variant`.
