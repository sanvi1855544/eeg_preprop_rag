`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.OutfeedDequeueTuple`

    
    tf.raw_ops.OutfeedDequeueTuple(
        dtypes, shapes, device_ordinal=-1, name=None
    )
    
This operation will block indefinitely until data is available. Output `i`
corresponds to XLA tuple element `i`.

Args  
---  
`dtypes` |  A list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`. The element types of each element in `outputs`.   
`shapes` |  A list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`). The shapes of each tensor in `outputs`.   
`device_ordinal` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `-1`. The TPU device to use. This should be -1 when the Op is running on a TPU device, and >= 0 when the Op is running on the CPU device.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A list of `Tensor` objects of type `dtypes`.
