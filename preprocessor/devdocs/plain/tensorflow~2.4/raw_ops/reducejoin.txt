`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.ReduceJoin`

    
    tf.raw_ops.ReduceJoin(
        inputs, reduction_indices, keep_dims=False, separator='', name=None
    )
    
Computes the string join across dimensions in the given string Tensor of shape
`[\\(d_0, d_1, ..., d_{n-1}\\)]`. Returns a new Tensor created by joining the
input strings with the given separator (default: empty string). Negative
indices are counted backwards from the end, with `-1` being equivalent to `n -
1`. If indices are not specified, joins across all dimensions beginning from
`n - 1` through `0`.

#### For example:

    
    # tensor `a` is [["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]]
    tf.reduce_join(a, 0) ==> ["ac", "bd"]
    tf.reduce_join(a, 1) ==> ["ab", "cd"]
    tf.reduce_join(a, -2) = tf.reduce_join(a, 0) ==> ["ac", "bd"]
    tf.reduce_join(a, -1) = tf.reduce_join(a, 1) ==> ["ab", "cd"]
    tf.reduce_join(a, 0, keep_dims=True) ==> [["ac", "bd"]]
    tf.reduce_join(a, 1, keep_dims=True) ==> [["ab"], ["cd"]]
    tf.reduce_join(a, 0, separator=".") ==> ["a.c", "b.d"]
    tf.reduce_join(a, [0, 1]) ==> "acbd"
    tf.reduce_join(a, [1, 0]) ==> "abcd"
    tf.reduce_join(a, []) ==> [["a", "b"], ["c", "d"]]
    tf.reduce_join(a) = tf.reduce_join(a, [1, 0]) ==> "abcd"
    
Args  
---  
`inputs` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. The input to be joined. All reduced indices must have non-zero size.   
`reduction_indices` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. The dimensions to reduce over. Dimensions are reduced in the order specified. Omitting `reduction_indices` is equivalent to passing `[n-1, n-2, ..., 0]`. Negative indices from `-n` to `-1` are supported.   
`keep_dims` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If `True`, retain reduced dimensions with length `1`.   
`separator` |  An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`. The separator to use when joining.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `string`.
