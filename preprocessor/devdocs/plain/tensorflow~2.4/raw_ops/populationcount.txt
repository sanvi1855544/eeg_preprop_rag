`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.PopulationCount`

    
    tf.raw_ops.PopulationCount(
        x, name=None
    )
    
For each entry in `x`, calculates the number of `1` (on) bits in the binary
representation of that entry.

> Note: It is more efficient to first `tf.bitcast` your tensors into `int32`
> or `int64` and perform the bitcount on the result, than to feed in 8- or
> 16-bit inputs and then aggregate the resulting counts.
Args  
---  
`x` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `uint8`.
