`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.FusedResizeAndPadConv2D`

    
    tf.raw_ops.FusedResizeAndPadConv2D(
        input, size, paddings, filter, mode, strides, padding,
        resize_align_corners=False, name=None
    )
    
It's often possible to do spatial transformations more efficiently as part of
the packing stage of a convolution, so this op allows for an optimized
implementation where these stages are fused together. This prevents the need
to write out the intermediate results as whole tensors, reducing memory
pressure, and we can get some latency gains by merging the transformation
calculations. The data_format attribute for Conv2D isn't supported by this op,
and defaults to 'NHWC' order. Internally this op uses a single per-graph
scratch buffer, which means that it will block if multiple versions are being
run in parallel. This is because this operator is primarily an optimization to
minimize memory usage.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`, `float64`. 4-D with shape `[batch, in_height, in_width, in_channels]`.   
`size` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. A 1-D int32 Tensor of 2 elements: `new_height, new_width`. The new size for the images.   
`paddings` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. A two-column matrix specifying the padding sizes. The number of rows must be the same as the rank of `input`.   
`filter` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `input`. 4-D with shape `[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`.   
`mode` |  A `string` from: `"REFLECT", "SYMMETRIC"`.   
`strides` |  A list of `ints`. 1-D of length 4. The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of `input`. Must be in the same order as the dimension specified with format.   
`padding` |  A `string` from: `"SAME", "VALID"`. The type of padding algorithm to use.   
`resize_align_corners` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If true, the centers of the 4 corner pixels of the input and output tensors are aligned, preserving the values at the corner pixels. Defaults to false.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
