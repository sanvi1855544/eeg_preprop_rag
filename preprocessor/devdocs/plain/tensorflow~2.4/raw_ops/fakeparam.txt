valid output when run, so must either be removed (e.g. replaced with a
function input) or guaranteed not to be used (e.g. if mirroring an
intermediate output needed for the gradient computation of the other branch).

Args  
---  
`dtype` |  A `tf.DType`. The type of the output.   
`shape` |  A `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`. The purported shape of the output. This is only used for shape inference; the output will not necessarily have this shape. Can be a partial shape.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `dtype`.
