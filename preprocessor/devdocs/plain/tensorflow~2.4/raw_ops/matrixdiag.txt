    tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiag(
        diagonal, name=None
    )
    
Given a `diagonal`, this operation returns a tensor with the `diagonal` and
everything else padded with zeros. The diagonal is computed as follows:

Assume `diagonal` has `k` dimensions `[I, J, K, ..., N]`, then the output is a
tensor of rank `k+1` with dimensions [I, J, K, ..., N, N]` where:

`output[i, j, k, ..., m, n] = 1{m=n} * diagonal[i, j, k, ..., n]`.

#### For example:

    
    # 'diagonal' is [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]
    
    and diagonal.shape = (2, 4)
    
    tf.matrix_diag(diagonal) ==> [[[1, 0, 0, 0]
                                         [0, 2, 0, 0]
                                         [0, 0, 3, 0]
                                         [0, 0, 0, 4]],
                                        [[5, 0, 0, 0]
                                         [0, 6, 0, 0]
                                         [0, 0, 7, 0]
                                         [0, 0, 0, 8]]]
    
    which has shape (2, 4, 4)
    
Args  
---  
`diagonal` |  A `Tensor`. Rank `k`, where `k >= 1`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `diagonal`.
