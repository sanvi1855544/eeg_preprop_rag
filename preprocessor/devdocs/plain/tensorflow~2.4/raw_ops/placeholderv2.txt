`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.PlaceholderV2`

    
    tf.raw_ops.PlaceholderV2(
        dtype, shape, name=None
    )
    
N.B. This operation will fail with an error if it is executed. It is intended
as a way to represent a value that will always be fed, and to provide attrs
that enable the fed value to be checked at runtime.

Args  
---  
`dtype` |  A `tf.DType`. The type of elements in the tensor.   
`shape` |  A `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`. The shape of the tensor. The shape can be any partially-specified shape. To be unconstrained, pass in a shape with unknown rank.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `dtype`.
