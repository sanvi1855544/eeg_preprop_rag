`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.TensorArrayGradV3`

    
    tf.raw_ops.TensorArrayGradV3(
        handle, flow_in, source, name=None
    )
    
If the given TensorArray gradient already exists, returns a reference to it.

Locks the size of the original TensorArray by disabling its dynamic size flag.

A note about the input flow_in:

The handle flow_in forces the execution of the gradient lookup to occur only
after certain other operations have occurred. For example, when the forward
TensorArray is dynamically sized, writes to this TensorArray may resize the
object. The gradient TensorArray is statically sized based on the size of the
forward TensorArray when this operation executes. Furthermore, the size of the
forward TensorArray is frozen by this call. As a result, the flow is used to
ensure that the call to generate the gradient TensorArray only happens after
all writes are executed.

In the case of dynamically sized TensorArrays, gradient computation should
only be performed on read operations that have themselves been chained via
flow to occur only after all writes have executed. That way the final size of
the forward TensorArray is known when this operation is called.

A note about the source attribute:

TensorArray gradient calls use an accumulator TensorArray object. If multiple
gradients are calculated and run in the same session, the multiple gradient
nodes may accidentally flow through the same accumulator TensorArray. This
double counts and generally breaks the TensorArray gradient flow.

The solution is to identify which gradient call this particular TensorArray
gradient is being called in. This is performed by identifying a unique string
(e.g. "gradients", "gradients_1", ...) from the input gradient Tensor's name.
This string is used as a suffix when creating the TensorArray gradient object
here (the attribute `source`).

The attribute `source` is added as a suffix to the forward TensorArray's name
when performing the creation / lookup, so that each separate gradient
calculation gets its own TensorArray accumulator.
