`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.RandomGamma`

    
    tf.raw_ops.RandomGamma(
        shape, alpha, seed=0, seed2=0, name=None
    )
    
This op uses the algorithm by Marsaglia et al. to acquire samples via
transformation-rejection from pairs of uniform and normal random variables.

Args  
---  
`shape` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. 1-D integer tensor. Shape of independent samples to draw from each distribution described by the shape parameters given in alpha.   
`alpha` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`, `float64`. A tensor in which each scalar is a "shape" parameter describing the associated gamma distribution.   
`seed` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. If either `seed` or `seed2` are set to be non-zero, the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, it is seeded by a random seed.   
`seed2` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. A second seed to avoid seed collision.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `alpha`.
