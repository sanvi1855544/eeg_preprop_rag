    tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagPart(
        input, name=None
    )
    
This operation returns a tensor with the `diagonal` part of the batched
`input`. The `diagonal` part is computed as follows:

Assume `input` has `k` dimensions `[I, J, K, ..., M, N]`, then the output is a
tensor of rank `k - 1` with dimensions `[I, J, K, ..., min(M, N)]` where:

`diagonal[i, j, k, ..., n] = input[i, j, k, ..., n, n]`.

The input must be at least a matrix.

#### For example:

    
    # 'input' is [[[1, 0, 0, 0]
                   [0, 2, 0, 0]
                   [0, 0, 3, 0]
                   [0, 0, 0, 4]],
                  [[5, 0, 0, 0]
                   [0, 6, 0, 0]
                   [0, 0, 7, 0]
                   [0, 0, 0, 8]]]
    
    and input.shape = (2, 4, 4)
    
    tf.matrix_diag_part(input) ==> [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]
    
    which has shape (2, 4)
    
Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Rank `k` tensor where `k >= 2`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---
