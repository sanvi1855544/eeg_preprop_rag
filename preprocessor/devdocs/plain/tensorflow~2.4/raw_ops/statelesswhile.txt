`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.StatelessWhile`

    
    tf.raw_ops.StatelessWhile(
        input, cond, body, output_shapes=[], parallel_iterations=10, name=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`input` |  A list of `Tensor` objects. A list of input tensors whose types are T.   
`cond` |  A function decorated with @Defun. A function takes 'input' and returns a tensor. If the tensor is a scalar of non-boolean, the scalar is converted to a boolean according to the following rule: if the scalar is a numerical value, non-zero means True and zero means False; if the scalar is a string, non-empty means True and empty means False. If the tensor is not a scalar, non-emptiness means True and False otherwise. This should only be used when the while condition and body functions do not have stateful ops.   
`body` |  A function decorated with @Defun. A function that takes a list of tensors and returns another list of tensors. Both lists have the same types as specified by T.   
`output_shapes` |  An optional list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`). Defaults to `[]`.   
`parallel_iterations` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `10`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A list of `Tensor` objects. Has the same type as `input`.
