`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Lu`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Lu(
        input, output_idx_type=tf.dtypes.int32, name=None
    )
    
The input is a tensor of shape `[..., M, M]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions
form square matrices.

The input has to be invertible.

The output consists of two tensors LU and P containing the LU decomposition of
all input submatrices `[..., :, :]`. LU encodes the lower triangular and upper
triangular factors.

For each input submatrix of shape `[M, M]`, L is a lower triangular matrix of
shape `[M, M]` with unit diagonal whose entries correspond to the strictly
lower triangular part of LU. U is a upper triangular matrix of shape `[M, M]`
whose entries correspond to the upper triangular part, including the diagonal,
of LU.

P represents a permutation matrix encoded as a list of indices each between
`0` and `M-1`, inclusive. If P_mat denotes the permutation matrix
corresponding to P, then the L, U and P satisfies P_mat * input = L * U.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float64`, `float32`, `half`, `complex64`, `complex128`. A tensor of shape `[..., M, M]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions form matrices of size `[M, M]`.   
`output_idx_type` |  An optional `tf.DType` from: `tf.int32, tf.int64`. Defaults to `tf.int32`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (lu, p).  
`lu` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.   
`p` |  A `Tensor` of type `output_idx_type`.
