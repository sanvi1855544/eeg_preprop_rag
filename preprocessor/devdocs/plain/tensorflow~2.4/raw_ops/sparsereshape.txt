`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.SparseReshape`

    
    tf.raw_ops.SparseReshape(
        input_indices, input_shape, new_shape, name=None
    )
    
This operation has the same semantics as reshape on the represented dense
tensor. The `input_indices` are recomputed based on the requested `new_shape`.

If one component of `new_shape` is the special value -1, the size of that
dimension is computed so that the total dense size remains constant. At most
one component of `new_shape` can be -1. The number of dense elements implied
by `new_shape` must be the same as the number of dense elements originally
implied by `input_shape`.

Reshaping does not affect the order of values in the SparseTensor.

If the input tensor has rank `R_in` and `N` non-empty values, and `new_shape`
has length `R_out`, then `input_indices` has shape `[N, R_in]`, `input_shape`
has length `R_in`, `output_indices` has shape `[N, R_out]`, and `output_shape`
has length `R_out`.

Args  
---  
`input_indices` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. 2-D. `N x R_in` matrix with the indices of non-empty values in a SparseTensor.   
`input_shape` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. 1-D. `R_in` vector with the input SparseTensor's dense shape.   
`new_shape` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. 1-D. `R_out` vector with the requested new dense shape.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (output_indices, output_shape).  
`output_indices` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`.   
`output_shape` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`.
