`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.SparseApplyAdagrad`

    
    tf.raw_ops.SparseApplyAdagrad(
        var, accum, lr, grad, indices, use_locking=False, update_slots=True, name=None
    )
    
That is for rows we have grad for, we update var and accum as follows:

$$accum += grad * grad$$

$$var -= lr * grad * (1 / sqrt(accum))$$

Args  
---  
`var` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `uint8`, `int16`, `int8`, `complex64`, `int64`, `qint8`, `quint8`, `qint32`, `bfloat16`, `uint16`, `complex128`, `half`, `uint32`, `uint64`. Should be from a Variable().   
`accum` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Should be from a Variable().   
`lr` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Learning rate. Must be a scalar.   
`grad` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. The gradient.   
`indices` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. A vector of indices into the first dimension of var and accum.   
`use_locking` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If `True`, updating of the var and accum tensors will be protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.   
`update_slots` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A mutable `Tensor`. Has the same type as `var`.
