`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.SelfAdjointEig`

    
    tf.raw_ops.SelfAdjointEig(
        input, name=None
    )
    
The input is a tensor of shape `[..., M, M]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions
form square matrices, with the same constraints as the single matrix
SelfAdjointEig.

The result is a [..., M+1, M] matrix with [..., 0,:] containing the
eigenvalues, and subsequent [...,1:, :] containing the eigenvectors. The
eigenvalues are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float64`, `float32`, `half`. Shape is `[..., M, M]`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
