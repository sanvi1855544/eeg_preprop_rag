`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.SqrtGrad`

    
    tf.raw_ops.SqrtGrad(
        y, dy, name=None
    )
    
Specifically, `grad = dy * 0.5 / y`, where `y = sqrt(x)`, and `dy` is the
corresponding input gradient.

Args  
---  
`y` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `bfloat16`, `half`, `float32`, `float64`, `complex64`, `complex128`.   
`dy` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `y`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `y`.
