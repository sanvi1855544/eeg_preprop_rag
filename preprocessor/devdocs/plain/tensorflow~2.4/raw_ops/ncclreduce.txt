    tf.raw_ops.NcclReduce(
        input, reduction, name=None
    )
    
Reduces `input` from `num_devices` using `reduction` to a single device.

The graph should be constructed so that all inputs have a valid device
assignment, and the op itself is assigned one of these devices.

input: The input to the reduction. data: the value of the reduction across all
`num_devices` devices. reduction: the reduction operation to perform.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A list of at least 1 `Tensor` objects with the same type in: `half`, `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `int64`.   
`reduction` |  A `string` from: `"min", "max", "prod", "sum"`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
