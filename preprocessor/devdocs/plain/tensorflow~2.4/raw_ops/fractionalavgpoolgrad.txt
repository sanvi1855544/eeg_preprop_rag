`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad`

    
    tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad(
        orig_input_tensor_shape, out_backprop, row_pooling_sequence,
        col_pooling_sequence, overlapping=False, name=None
    )
    
Unlike FractionalMaxPoolGrad, we don't need to find arg_max for
FractionalAvgPoolGrad, we just need to evenly back-propagate each element of
out_backprop to those indices that form the same pooling cell. Therefore, we
just need to know the shape of original input tensor, instead of the whole
tensor.

Args  
---  
`orig_input_tensor_shape` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. Original input tensor shape for `fractional_avg_pool`  
`out_backprop` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `int64`. 4-D with shape `[batch, height, width, channels]`. Gradients w.r.t. the output of `fractional_avg_pool`.   
`row_pooling_sequence` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. row pooling sequence, form pooling region with col_pooling_sequence.   
`col_pooling_sequence` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. column pooling sequence, form pooling region with row_pooling sequence.   
`overlapping` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. When set to True, it means when pooling, the values at the boundary of adjacent pooling cells are used by both cells. For example: `index 0 1 2 3 4` `value 20 5 16 3 7` If the pooling sequence is [0, 2, 4], then 16, at index 2 will be used twice. The result would be [41/3, 26/3] for fractional avg pooling.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `out_backprop`.
