`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppression`

    
    tf.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppression(
        boxes, scores, max_output_size, iou_threshold=0.5, name=None
    )
    
pruning away boxes that have high intersection-over-union (IOU) overlap with
previously selected boxes. Bounding boxes are supplied as [y1, x1, y2, x2],
where (y1, x1) and (y2, x2) are the coordinates of any diagonal pair of box
corners and the coordinates can be provided as normalized (i.e., lying in the
interval [0, 1]) or absolute. Note that this algorithm is agnostic to where
the origin is in the coordinate system. Note that this algorithm is invariant
to orthogonal transformations and translations of the coordinate system; thus
translating or reflections of the coordinate system result in the same boxes
being selected by the algorithm. The output of this operation is a set of
integers indexing into the input collection of bounding boxes representing the
selected boxes. The bounding box coordinates corresponding to the selected
indices can then be obtained using the `tf.gather operation`. For example:
selected_indices = tf.image.non_max_suppression( boxes, scores,
max_output_size, iou_threshold) selected_boxes = tf.gather(boxes,
selected_indices)

Args  
---  
`boxes` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. A 2-D float tensor of shape `[num_boxes, 4]`.   
`scores` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. A 1-D float tensor of shape `[num_boxes]` representing a single score corresponding to each box (each row of boxes).   
`max_output_size` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. A scalar integer tensor representing the maximum number of boxes to be selected by non max suppression.   
`iou_threshold` |  An optional `float`. Defaults to `0.5`. A float representing the threshold for deciding whether boxes overlap too much with respect to IOU.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `int32`.
