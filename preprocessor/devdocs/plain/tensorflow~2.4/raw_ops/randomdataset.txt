`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.RandomDataset`

    
    tf.raw_ops.RandomDataset(
        seed, seed2, output_types, output_shapes, name=None
    )
    
Creates a Dataset that returns a stream of uniformly distributed pseudorandom
64-bit signed integers.

In the TensorFlow Python API, you can instantiate this dataset via the class
`tf.data.experimental.RandomDataset`.

Instances of this dataset are also created as a result of the
`hoist_random_uniform` static optimization. Whether this optimization is
performed is determined by the
`experimental_optimization.hoist_random_uniform` option of `tf.data.Options`.

Args  
---  
`seed` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. A scalar seed for the random number generator. If either seed or seed2 is set to be non-zero, the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, a random seed is used.   
`seed2` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. A second scalar seed to avoid seed collision.   
`output_types` |  A list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`.   
`output_shapes` |  A list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`) that has length `>= 1`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `variant`.
