`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.MapDefun`

    
    tf.raw_ops.MapDefun(
        arguments, captured_inputs, output_types, output_shapes, f,
        max_intra_op_parallelism=1, name=None
    )
    
The function given by `f` is assumed to be stateless, and is executed
concurrently on all the slices; up to batch_size (i.e. the size of the 0th
dimension of each argument) functions will be scheduled at once.

The `max_intra_op_parallelism` attr, which defaults to 1, can be used to limit
the intra op parallelism. To limit inter-op parallelism, a user can set a
private threadpool on the dataset using `tf.data.Options`'s
`ThreadingOptions`.

Note that this op is not exposed to users directly, but is invoked in tf.data
rewrites.

Args  
---  
`arguments` |  A list of `Tensor` objects. A list of tensors whose types are `Targuments`, corresponding to the inputs the function should be mapped over.   
`captured_inputs` |  A list of `Tensor` objects. A list of tensors whose types are `Tcaptured`, corresponding to the captured inputs of the defun.   
`output_types` |  A list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`. A list of types.   
`output_shapes` |  A list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`) that has length `>= 1`. A list of shapes.   
`f` |  A function decorated with @Defun.   
`max_intra_op_parallelism` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `1`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A list of `Tensor` objects of type `output_types`.
