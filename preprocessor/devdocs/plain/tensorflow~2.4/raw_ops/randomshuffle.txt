`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.RandomShuffle`

    
    tf.raw_ops.RandomShuffle(
        value, seed=0, seed2=0, name=None
    )
    
The tensor is shuffled along dimension 0, such that each `value[j]` is mapped
to one and only one `output[i]`. For example, a mapping that might occur for a
3x2 tensor is:

    
    [[1, 2],       [[5, 6],
     [3, 4],  ==>   [1, 2],
     [5, 6]]        [3, 4]]
    
Args  
---  
`value` |  A `Tensor`. The tensor to be shuffled.   
`seed` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. If either `seed` or `seed2` are set to be non-zero, the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, it is seeded by a random seed.   
`seed2` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. A second seed to avoid seed collision.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `value`.
