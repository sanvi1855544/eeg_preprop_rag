`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange`

    
    tf.raw_ops.QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange(
        input, input_min, input_max, out_type, name=None
    )
    
actual distribution of the values to maximize the usage of the lower bit depth
and adjusting the output min and max ranges accordingly.

[input_min, input_max] are scalar floats that specify the range for the float
interpretation of the 'input' data. For example, if input_min is -1.0f and
input_max is 1.0f, and we are dealing with quint16 quantized data, then a 0
value in the 16-bit data should be interpreted as -1.0f, and a 65535 means
1.0f.

This operator tries to squeeze as much precision as possible into an output
with a lower bit depth by calculating the actual min and max values found in
the data. For example, maybe that quint16 input has no values lower than
16,384 and none higher than 49,152. That means only half the range is actually
needed, all the float interpretations are between -0.5f and 0.5f, so if we
want to compress the data into a quint8 output, we can use that range rather
than the theoretical -1.0f to 1.0f that is suggested by the input min and max.

In practice, this is most useful for taking output from operations like
QuantizedMatMul that can produce higher bit-depth outputs than their inputs
and may have large potential output ranges, but in practice have a
distribution of input values that only uses a small fraction of the possible
range. By feeding that output into this operator, we can reduce it from 32
bits down to 8 with minimal loss of accuracy.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `qint8`, `quint8`, `qint32`, `qint16`, `quint16`.   
`input_min` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. The float value that the minimum quantized input value represents.   
`input_max` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. The float value that the maximum quantized input value represents.   
`out_type` |  A `tf.DType` from: `tf.qint8, tf.quint8, tf.qint32, tf.qint16, tf.quint16`. The type of the output. Should be a lower bit depth than Tinput.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (output, output_min, output_max).  
`output` |  A `Tensor` of type `out_type`.   
`output_min` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`.   
`output_max` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`.
