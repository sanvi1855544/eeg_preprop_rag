`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.RandomUniformInt`

    
    tf.raw_ops.RandomUniformInt(
        shape, minval, maxval, seed=0, seed2=0, name=None
    )
    
The generated values are uniform integers in the range `[minval, maxval)`. The
lower bound `minval` is included in the range, while the upper bound `maxval`
is excluded.

The random integers are slightly biased unless `maxval - minval` is an exact
power of two. The bias is small for values of `maxval - minval` significantly
smaller than the range of the output (either `2^32` or `2^64`).

Args  
---  
`shape` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. The shape of the output tensor.   
`minval` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. 0-D. Inclusive lower bound on the generated integers.   
`maxval` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `minval`. 0-D. Exclusive upper bound on the generated integers.   
`seed` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. If either `seed` or `seed2` are set to be non-zero, the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, it is seeded by a random seed.   
`seed2` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. A second seed to avoid seed collision.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `minval`.
