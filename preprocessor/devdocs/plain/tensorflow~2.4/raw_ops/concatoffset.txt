`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.ConcatOffset`

    
    tf.raw_ops.ConcatOffset(
        concat_dim, shape, name=None
    )
    
#### For example:

    
    # 'x' is [2, 2, 7]
    # 'y' is [2, 3, 7]
    # 'z' is [2, 5, 7]
    concat_offset(2, [x, y, z]) => [0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 5, 0]
    
This is typically used by gradient computations for a concat operation.

Args  
---  
`concat_dim` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. The dimension along which to concatenate.   
`shape` |  A list of at least 2 `Tensor` objects with type `int32`. The `N` int32 vectors representing shape of tensors being concatenated.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A list with the same length as `shape` of `Tensor` objects with type `int32`.
