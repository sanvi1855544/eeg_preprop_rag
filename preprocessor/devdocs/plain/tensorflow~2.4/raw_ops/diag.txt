`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Diag`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Diag(
        diagonal, name=None
    )
    
Given a `diagonal`, this operation returns a tensor with the `diagonal` and
everything else padded with zeros. The diagonal is computed as follows:

Assume `diagonal` has dimensions [D1,..., Dk], then the output is a tensor of
rank 2k with dimensions [D1,..., Dk, D1,..., Dk] where:

`output[i1,..., ik, i1,..., ik] = diagonal[i1, ..., ik]` and 0 everywhere
else.

#### For example:

    
    # 'diagonal' is [1, 2, 3, 4]
    tf.diag(diagonal) ==> [[1, 0, 0, 0]
                           [0, 2, 0, 0]
                           [0, 0, 3, 0]
                           [0, 0, 0, 4]]
    
Args  
---  
`diagonal` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `bfloat16`, `half`, `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `int64`, `complex64`, `complex128`. Rank k tensor where k is at most 1.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `diagonal`.
