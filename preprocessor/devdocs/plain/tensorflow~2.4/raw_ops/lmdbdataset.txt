`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.LMDBDataset`

    
    tf.raw_ops.LMDBDataset(
        filenames, output_types, output_shapes, name=None
    )
    
The Lightning Memory-Mapped Database Manager, or LMDB, is an embedded binary
key-value database. This dataset can read the contents of LMDB database files,
the names of which generally have the `.mdb` suffix.

Each output element consists of a key-value pair represented as a pair of
scalar string `Tensor`s, where the first `Tensor` contains the key and the
second `Tensor` contains the value.

LMDB uses different file formats on big- and little-endian machines.
`LMDBDataset` can only read files in the format of the host machine.

Args  
---  
`filenames` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. A scalar or a vector containing the name(s) of the binary file(s) to be read.   
`output_types` |  A list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`.   
`output_shapes` |  A list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`) that has length `>= 1`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `variant`.
