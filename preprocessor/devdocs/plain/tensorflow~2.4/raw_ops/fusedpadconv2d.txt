`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.FusedPadConv2D`

    
    tf.raw_ops.FusedPadConv2D(
        input, paddings, filter, mode, strides, padding, name=None
    )
    
Similar to FusedResizeAndPadConv2d, this op allows for an optimized
implementation where the spatial padding transformation stage is fused with
the im2col lookup, but in this case without the bilinear filtering required
for resizing. Fusing the padding prevents the need to write out the
intermediate results as whole tensors, reducing memory pressure, and we can
get some latency gains by merging the transformation calculations. The
data_format attribute for Conv2D isn't supported by this op, and 'NHWC' order
is used instead. Internally this op uses a single per-graph scratch buffer,
which means that it will block if multiple versions are being run in parallel.
This is because this operator is primarily an optimization to minimize memory
usage.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`, `float64`. 4-D with shape `[batch, in_height, in_width, in_channels]`.   
`paddings` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. A two-column matrix specifying the padding sizes. The number of rows must be the same as the rank of `input`.   
`filter` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `input`. 4-D with shape `[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`.   
`mode` |  A `string` from: `"REFLECT", "SYMMETRIC"`.   
`strides` |  A list of `ints`. 1-D of length 4. The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of `input`. Must be in the same order as the dimension specified with format.   
`padding` |  A `string` from: `"SAME", "VALID"`. The type of padding algorithm to use.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
