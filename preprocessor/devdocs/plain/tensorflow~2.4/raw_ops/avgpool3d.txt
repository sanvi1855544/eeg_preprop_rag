`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.AvgPool3D`

    
    tf.raw_ops.AvgPool3D(
        input, ksize, strides, padding, data_format='NDHWC', name=None
    )
    
Each entry in `output` is the mean of the corresponding size `ksize` window in
`value`.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `bfloat16`, `float32`, `float64`. Shape `[batch, depth, rows, cols, channels]` tensor to pool over.   
`ksize` |  A list of `ints` that has length `>= 5`. 1-D tensor of length 5. The size of the window for each dimension of the input tensor. Must have `ksize[0] = ksize[4] = 1`.   
`strides` |  A list of `ints` that has length `>= 5`. 1-D tensor of length 5. The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of `input`. Must have `strides[0] = strides[4] = 1`.   
`padding` |  A `string` from: `"SAME", "VALID"`. The type of padding algorithm to use.   
`data_format` |  An optional `string` from: `"NDHWC", "NCDHW"`. Defaults to `"NDHWC"`. The data format of the input and output data. With the default format "NDHWC", the data is stored in the order of: [batch, in_depth, in_height, in_width, in_channels]. Alternatively, the format could be "NCDHW", the data storage order is: [batch, in_channels, in_depth, in_height, in_width].   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
