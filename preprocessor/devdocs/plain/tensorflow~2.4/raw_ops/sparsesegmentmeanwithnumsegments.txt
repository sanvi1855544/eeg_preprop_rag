`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.SparseSegmentMeanWithNumSegments`

    
    tf.raw_ops.SparseSegmentMeanWithNumSegments(
        data, indices, segment_ids, num_segments, name=None
    )
    
Like `SparseSegmentMean`, but allows missing ids in `segment_ids`. If an id is
missing, the `output` tensor at that position will be zeroed.

Read the section on segmentation for an explanation of segments.

Args  
---  
`data` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `bfloat16`, `float32`, `float64`.   
`indices` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. A 1-D tensor. Has same rank as `segment_ids`.   
`segment_ids` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. A 1-D tensor. Values should be sorted and can be repeated.   
`num_segments` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. Should equal the number of distinct segment IDs.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `data`.
