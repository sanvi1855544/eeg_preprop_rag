`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCellGrad`

    
    tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCellGrad(
        x, cs_prev, h_prev, w, wci, wcf, wco, b, i, cs, f, o, ci, co, cs_grad, h_grad,
        use_peephole, name=None
    )
    
This implementation is to be used in conjunction of LSTMBlockCell.

Args  
---

`cs_prev` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The previous cell state.   
`h_prev` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The previous h state.   
`w` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The weight matrix.   
`wci` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The weight matrix for input gate peephole connection.   
`wcf` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The weight matrix for forget gate peephole connection.   
`wco` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The weight matrix for output gate peephole connection.   
`b` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The bias vector.   
`i` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The input gate.   
`cs` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The cell state before the tanh.

`o` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The output gate.   
`ci` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The cell input.   
`co` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The cell after the tanh.   
`cs_grad` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The current gradient of cs.   
`h_grad` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The gradient of h vector.   
`use_peephole` |  A `bool`. Whether the cell uses peephole connections.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---

wco_grad).  
`cs_prev_grad` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.
