`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.OutfeedDequeueTupleV2`

    
    tf.raw_ops.OutfeedDequeueTupleV2(
        device_ordinal, dtypes, shapes, name=None
    )
    
tensor allowing dynamic outfeed.

This operation will block indefinitely until data is available. Output `i`
corresponds to XLA tuple element `i`.

Args: device_ordinal: A `Tensor` of type `int32`. An int scalar tensor,
representing the TPU device to use. This should be -1 when the Op is running
on a TPU device, and >= 0 when the Op is running on the CPU device. dtypes: A
list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`. The element types of each element
in `outputs`. shapes: A list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of
`ints`). The shapes of each tensor in `outputs`. name: A name for the
operation (optional).

Returns: A list of `Tensor` objects of type `dtypes`.
