`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.SparseAccumulatorTakeGradient`

    
    tf.raw_ops.SparseAccumulatorTakeGradient(
        handle, num_required, dtype, name=None
    )
    
The op will blocks until sufficient (i.e., more than num_required) gradients
have been accumulated. If the accumulator has already aggregated more than
num_required gradients, it will return its average of the accumulated
gradients. Also automatically increments the recorded global_step in the
accumulator by 1, and resets the aggregate to 0.

Args  
---  
`handle` |  A `Tensor` of type mutable `string`. The handle to a SparseConditionalAccumulator.   
`num_required` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. Number of gradients required before we return an aggregate.   
`dtype` |  A `tf.DType` from: `tf.float32, tf.float64, tf.int32, tf.uint8, tf.int16, tf.int8, tf.complex64, tf.int64, tf.qint8, tf.quint8, tf.qint32, tf.bfloat16, tf.uint16, tf.complex128, tf.half, tf.uint32, tf.uint64`. The data type of accumulated gradients. Needs to correspond to the type of the accumulator.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (indices, values, shape).  
`indices` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`.   
`values` |  A `Tensor` of type `dtype`.   
`shape` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`.
