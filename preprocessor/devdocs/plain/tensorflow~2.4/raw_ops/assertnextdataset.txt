`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.AssertNextDataset`

    
    tf.raw_ops.AssertNextDataset(
        input_dataset, transformations, output_types, output_shapes, name=None
    )
    
This transformation checks whether the camel-case names (i.e. "FlatMap", not
"flat_map") of the transformations following this transformation match the
list of names in the `transformations` argument. If there is a mismatch, the
transformation raises an exception.

The check occurs when iterating over the contents of the dataset, which means
that the check happens after any static optimizations are applied to the
dataset graph.

Args  
---  
`input_dataset` |  A `Tensor` of type `variant`. A variant tensor representing the input dataset. `AssertNextDataset` passes through the outputs of its input dataset.   
`transformations` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. A `tf.string` vector `tf.Tensor` identifying the transformations that are expected to happen next.   
`output_types` |  A list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`.   
`output_shapes` |  A list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`) that has length `>= 1`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `variant`.
