    tf.raw_ops.BlockLSTMGrad(
        seq_len_max, x, cs_prev, h_prev, w, wci, wcf, wco, b, i, cs, f, o, ci, co, h,

This implementation is to be used in conjunction of LSTMBlock.

Args  
---  
`seq_len_max` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. Maximum time length actually used by this input. Outputs are padded with zeros beyond this length.   
`x` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`. The sequence input to the LSTM, shape (timelen, batch_size, num_inputs).   
`cs_prev` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. Value of the initial cell state.   
`h_prev` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. Initial output of cell (to be used for peephole).   
`w` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The weight matrix.   
`wci` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The weight matrix for input gate peephole connection.   
`wcf` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The weight matrix for forget gate peephole connection.   
`wco` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The weight matrix for output gate peephole connection.   
`b` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The bias vector.   
`i` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The input gate over the whole time sequence.   
`cs` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The cell state before the tanh over the whole time sequence.   
`f` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The forget gate over the whole time sequence.   
`o` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The output gate over the whole time sequence.   
`ci` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The cell input over the whole time sequence.   
`co` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The cell after the tanh over the whole time sequence.   
`h` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The output h vector over the whole time sequence.   
`cs_grad` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The current gradient of cs.   
`h_grad` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. The gradient of h vector.   
`use_peephole` |  A `bool`. Whether to use peephole weights.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---
