`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Assign`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Assign(
        ref, value, validate_shape=True, use_locking=True, name=None
    )
    
This operation outputs "ref" after the assignment is done. This makes it
easier to chain operations that need to use the reset value.

Args  
---  
`ref` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Should be from a `Variable` node. May be uninitialized.   
`value` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `ref`. The value to be assigned to the variable.   
`validate_shape` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`. If true, the operation will validate that the shape of 'value' matches the shape of the Tensor being assigned to. If false, 'ref' will take on the shape of 'value'.   
`use_locking` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`. If True, the assignment will be protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A mutable `Tensor`. Has the same type as `ref`.
