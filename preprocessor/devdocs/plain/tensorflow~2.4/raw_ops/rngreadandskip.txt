`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.RngReadAndSkip`

    
    tf.raw_ops.RngReadAndSkip(
        resource, alg, delta, name=None
    )
    
The state of the RNG after `rng_read_and_skip(n)` will be the same as that
after `uniform([n])` (or any other distribution). The actual increment added
to the counter is an unspecified implementation choice.

Args  
---  
`resource` |  A `Tensor` of type `resource`. The handle of the resource variable that stores the state of the RNG.   
`alg` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. The RNG algorithm.   
`delta` |  A `Tensor` of type `uint64`. The amount of advancement.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `int64`.
