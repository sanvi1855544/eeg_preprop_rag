`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Fill`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Fill(
        dims, value, name=None
    )
    
This operation creates a tensor of shape `dims` and fills it with `value`.

#### For example:

    
    # Output tensor has shape [2, 3].
    fill([2, 3], 9) ==> [[9, 9, 9]
                         [9, 9, 9]]
    
`tf.fill` differs from `tf.constant` in a few ways:

  * `tf.fill` only supports scalar contents, whereas `tf.constant` supports Tensor values.
  * `tf.fill` creates an Op in the computation graph that constructs the actual Tensor value at runtime. This is in contrast to `tf.constant` which embeds the entire Tensor into the graph with a `Const` node.
  * Because `tf.fill` evaluates at graph runtime, it supports dynamic shapes based on other runtime Tensors, unlike `tf.constant`.

Args  
---  
`dims` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. 1-D. Represents the shape of the output tensor.   
`value` |  A `Tensor`. 0-D (scalar). Value to fill the returned tensor.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `value`.
