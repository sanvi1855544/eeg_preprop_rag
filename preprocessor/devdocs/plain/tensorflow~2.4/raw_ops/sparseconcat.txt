`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.SparseConcat`

    
    tf.raw_ops.SparseConcat(
        indices, values, shapes, concat_dim, name=None
    )
    
Concatenation is with respect to the dense versions of these sparse tensors.
It is assumed that each input is a `SparseTensor` whose elements are ordered
along increasing dimension number.

All inputs' shapes must match, except for the concat dimension. The `indices`,
`values`, and `shapes` lists must have the same length.

The output shape is identical to the inputs', except along the concat
dimension, where it is the sum of the inputs' sizes along that dimension.

The output elements will be resorted to preserve the sort order along
increasing dimension number.

This op runs in `O(M log M)` time, where `M` is the total number of non-empty
values across all inputs. This is due to the need for an internal sort in
order to concatenate efficiently across an arbitrary dimension.

For example, if `concat_dim = 1` and the inputs are

    
    sp_inputs[0]: shape = [2, 3]
    [0, 2]: "a"
    [1, 0]: "b"
    [1, 1]: "c"
    
    sp_inputs[1]: shape = [2, 4]
    [0, 1]: "d"
    [0, 2]: "e"
    
then the output will be

    
    shape = [2, 7]
    [0, 2]: "a"
    [0, 4]: "d"
    [0, 5]: "e"
    [1, 0]: "b"
    [1, 1]: "c"
    
Graphically this is equivalent to doing

    
    [    a] concat [  d e  ] = [    a   d e  ]
    [b c  ]        [       ]   [b c          ]
    
Args  
---  
`indices` |  A list of at least 2 `Tensor` objects with type `int64`. 2-D. Indices of each input `SparseTensor`.   
`values` |  A list with the same length as `indices` of `Tensor` objects with the same type. 1-D. Non-empty values of each `SparseTensor`.   
`shapes` |  A list with the same length as `indices` of `Tensor` objects with type `int64`. 1-D. Shapes of each `SparseTensor`.   
`concat_dim` |  An `int`. Dimension to concatenate along. Must be in range [-rank, rank), where rank is the number of dimensions in each input `SparseTensor`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (output_indices, output_values, output_shape).  
`output_indices` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`.   
`output_values` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `values`.   
`output_shape` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`.
