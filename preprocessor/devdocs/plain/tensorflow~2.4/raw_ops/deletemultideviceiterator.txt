`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.DeleteMultiDeviceIterator`

    
    tf.raw_ops.DeleteMultiDeviceIterator(
        multi_device_iterator, iterators, deleter, name=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`multi_device_iterator` |  A `Tensor` of type `resource`. A handle to the multi device iterator to delete.   
`iterators` |  A list of `Tensor` objects with type `resource`. A list of iterator handles (unused). This is added so that automatic control dependencies get added during function tracing that ensure this op runs after all the dependent iterators are deleted.   
`deleter` |  A `Tensor` of type `variant`. A variant deleter.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The created Operation.
