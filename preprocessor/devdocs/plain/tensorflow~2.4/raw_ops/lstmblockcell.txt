`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell`

    
    tf.raw_ops.LSTMBlockCell(
        x, cs_prev, h_prev, w, wci, wcf, wco, b, forget_bias=1, cell_clip=3,
        use_peephole=False, name=None
    )
    
This implementation uses 1 weight matrix and 1 bias vector, and there's an
optional peephole connection.

This kernel op implements the following mathematical equations:

    
    xh = [x, h_prev]
    [i, f, ci, o] = xh * w + b
    f = f + forget_bias
    
    if not use_peephole:
      wci = wcf = wco = 0
    
    i = sigmoid(cs_prev * wci + i)
    f = sigmoid(cs_prev * wcf + f)
    ci = tanh(ci)
    
    cs = ci .* i + cs_prev .* f
    cs = clip(cs, cell_clip)
    
    o = sigmoid(cs * wco + o)
    co = tanh(cs)
    h = co .* o
