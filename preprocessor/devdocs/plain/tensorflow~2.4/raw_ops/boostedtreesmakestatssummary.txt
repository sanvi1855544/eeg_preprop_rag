`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.BoostedTreesMakeStatsSummary`

    
    tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesMakeStatsSummary(
        node_ids, gradients, hessians, bucketized_features_list, max_splits,
        num_buckets, name=None
    )
    
The summary stats contains gradients and hessians accumulated into the
corresponding node and bucket for each example.

Args  
---  
`node_ids` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. int32 Rank 1 Tensor containing node ids, which each example falls into for the requested layer.   
`gradients` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. float32; Rank 2 Tensor (shape=[#examples, 1]) for gradients.   
`hessians` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. float32; Rank 2 Tensor (shape=[#examples, 1]) for hessians.   
`bucketized_features_list` |  A list of at least 1 `Tensor` objects with type `int32`. int32 list of Rank 1 Tensors, each containing the bucketized feature (for each feature column).   
`max_splits` |  An `int` that is `>= 1`. int; the maximum number of splits possible in the whole tree.   
`num_buckets` |  An `int` that is `>= 1`. int; equals to the maximum possible value of bucketized feature.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `float32`.
