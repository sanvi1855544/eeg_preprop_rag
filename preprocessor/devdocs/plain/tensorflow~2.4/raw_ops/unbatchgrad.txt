`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.UnbatchGrad`

    
    tf.raw_ops.UnbatchGrad(
        original_input, batch_index, grad, id, container='',
        shared_name='', name=None
    )
    
Acts like Batch but using the given batch_index index of batching things as
they become available. This ensures that the gradients are propagated back in
the same session which did the forward pass.

original_input: The input to the Unbatch operation this is the gradient of.
batch_index: The batch_index given to the Unbatch operation this is the
gradient of. grad: The downstream gradient. id: The id scalar emitted by
Batch. batched_grad: The return value, either an empty tensor or the batched
gradient. container: Container to control resource sharing. shared_name:
Instances of UnbatchGrad with the same container and shared_name are assumed
to possibly belong to the same batch. If left empty, the op name will be used
as the shared name.

Args
