`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.BoostedTreesAggregateStats`

    
    tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesAggregateStats(
        node_ids, gradients, hessians, feature, max_splits, num_buckets, name=None
    )
    
The summary stats contains gradients and hessians accumulated for each node,
feature dimension id and bucket.

Args  
---  
`node_ids` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. int32; Rank 1 Tensor containing node ids for each example, shape [batch_size].   
`gradients` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. float32; Rank 2 Tensor (shape=[batch_size, logits_dimension]) with gradients for each example.   
`hessians` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. float32; Rank 2 Tensor (shape=[batch_size, hessian_dimension]) with hessians for each example.   
`feature` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. int32; Rank 2 feature Tensors (shape=[batch_size, feature_dimension]).   
`max_splits` |  An `int` that is `>= 1`. int; the maximum number of splits possible in the whole tree.   
`num_buckets` |  An `int` that is `>= 1`. int; equals to the maximum possible value of bucketized feature.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns
