`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.IteratorGetNextSync`

    
    tf.raw_ops.IteratorGetNextSync(
        iterator, output_types, output_shapes, name=None
    )
    
This operation is a synchronous version IteratorGetNext. It should only be
used in situations where the iterator does not block the calling thread, or
where the calling thread is not a member of the thread pool used to execute
parallel operations (e.g. in eager mode).

Args  
---  
`iterator` |  A `Tensor` of type `resource`.   
`output_types` |  A list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`.   
`output_shapes` |  A list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`) that has length `>= 1`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A list of `Tensor` objects of type `output_types`.
