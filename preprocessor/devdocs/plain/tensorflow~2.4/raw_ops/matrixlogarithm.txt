`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.MatrixLogarithm`

    
    tf.raw_ops.MatrixLogarithm(
        input, name=None
    )
    
\\(log(exp(A)) = A\\)

This op is only defined for complex matrices. If A is positive-definite and
real, then casting to a complex matrix, taking the logarithm and casting back
to a real matrix will give the correct result.

This function computes the matrix logarithm using the Schur-Parlett algorithm.
Details of the algorithm can be found in Section 11.6.2 of: Nicholas J.
Higham, Functions of Matrices: Theory and Computation, SIAM 2008. ISBN
978-0-898716-46-7.

The input is a tensor of shape `[..., M, M]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions
form square matrices. The output is a tensor of the same shape as the input
containing the exponential for all input submatrices `[..., :, :]`.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `complex64`, `complex128`. Shape is `[..., M, M]`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
