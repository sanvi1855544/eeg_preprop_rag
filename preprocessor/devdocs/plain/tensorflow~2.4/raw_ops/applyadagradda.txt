`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.ApplyAdagradDA`

    
    tf.raw_ops.ApplyAdagradDA(
        var, gradient_accumulator, gradient_squared_accumulator, grad, lr, l1, l2,
        global_step, use_locking=False, name=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`var` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `uint8`, `int16`, `int8`, `complex64`, `int64`, `qint8`, `quint8`, `qint32`, `bfloat16`, `uint16`, `complex128`, `half`, `uint32`, `uint64`. Should be from a Variable().   
`gradient_accumulator` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Should be from a Variable().   
`gradient_squared_accumulator` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Should be from a Variable().   
`grad` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. The gradient.   
`lr` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. Scaling factor. Must be a scalar.   
`l1` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. L1 regularization. Must be a scalar.   
`l2` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `var`. L2 regularization. Must be a scalar.   
`global_step` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. Training step number. Must be a scalar.   
`use_locking` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If True, updating of the var and accum tensors will be protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A mutable `Tensor`. Has the same type as `var`.
