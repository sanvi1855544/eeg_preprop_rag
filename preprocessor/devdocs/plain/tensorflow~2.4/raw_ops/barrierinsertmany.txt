`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.BarrierInsertMany`

    
    tf.raw_ops.BarrierInsertMany(
        handle, keys, values, component_index, name=None
    )
    
If a key is not found in the barrier, this operation will create a new
incomplete element. If a key is found in the barrier, and the element already
has a value at component_index, this operation will fail with
INVALID_ARGUMENT, and leave the barrier in an undefined state.

Args  
---  
`handle` |  A `Tensor` of type mutable `string`. The handle to a barrier.   
`keys` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. A one-dimensional tensor of keys, with length n.   
`values` |  A `Tensor`. An any-dimensional tensor of values, which are associated with the respective keys. The 0th dimension must have length n.   
`component_index` |  An `int`. The component of the barrier elements that is being assigned.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The created Operation.
