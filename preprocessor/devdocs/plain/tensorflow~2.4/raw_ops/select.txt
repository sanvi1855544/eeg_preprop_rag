`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Select`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Select(
        condition, x, y, name=None
    )
    
The `x`, and `y` tensors must all have the same shape, and the output will
also have that shape.

The `condition` tensor must be a scalar if `x` and `y` are scalars. If `x` and
`y` are vectors or higher rank, then `condition` must be either a scalar, a
vector with size matching the first dimension of `x`, or must have the same
shape as `x`.

The `condition` tensor acts as a mask that chooses, based on the value at each
element, whether the corresponding element / row in the output should be taken
from `x` (if true) or `y` (if false).

If `condition` is a vector and `x` and `y` are higher rank matrices, then it
chooses which row (outer dimension) to copy from `x` and `y`. If `condition`
has the same shape as `x` and `y`, then it chooses which element to copy from
`x` and `y`.

#### For example:

    
    # 'condition' tensor is [[True,  False]
    #                        [False, True]]
    # 't' is [[1, 2],
    #         [3, 4]]
    # 'e' is [[5, 6],
    #         [7, 8]]
    select(condition, t, e)  # => [[1, 6], [7, 4]]
    
    
    # 'condition' tensor is [True, False]
    # 't' is [[1, 2],
    #         [3, 4]]
    # 'e' is [[5, 6],
    #         [7, 8]]
    select(condition, t, e) ==> [[1, 2],
                                 [7, 8]]
    
    
Args  
---  
`condition` |  A `Tensor` of type `bool`.   
`x` |  A `Tensor` which may have the same shape as `condition`. If `condition` is rank 1, `x` may have higher rank, but its first dimension must match the size of `condition`.   
`y` |  A `Tensor` with the same type and shape as `x`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `t`.
