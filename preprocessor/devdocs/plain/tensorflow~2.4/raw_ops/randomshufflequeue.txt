`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.RandomShuffleQueue`

    
    tf.raw_ops.RandomShuffleQueue(
        component_types, shapes=[], capacity=-1, min_after_dequeue=0, seed=0, seed2=0,
        container='', shared_name='', name=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`component_types` |  A list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`. The type of each component in a value.   
`shapes` |  An optional list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`). Defaults to `[]`. The shape of each component in a value. The length of this attr must be either 0 or the same as the length of component_types. If the length of this attr is 0, the shapes of queue elements are not constrained, and only one element may be dequeued at a time.   
`capacity` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `-1`. The upper bound on the number of elements in this queue. Negative numbers mean no limit.   
`min_after_dequeue` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. Dequeue will block unless there would be this many elements after the dequeue or the queue is closed. This ensures a minimum level of mixing of elements.   
`seed` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. If either seed or seed2 is set to be non-zero, the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise, a random seed is used.   
`seed2` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. A second seed to avoid seed collision.   
`container` |  An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`. If non-empty, this queue is placed in the given container. Otherwise, a default container is used.   
`shared_name` |  An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`. If non-empty, this queue will be shared under the given name across multiple sessions.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type mutable `string`.
