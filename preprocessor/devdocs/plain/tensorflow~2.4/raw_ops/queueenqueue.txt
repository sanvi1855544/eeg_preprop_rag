`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.QueueEnqueue`

    
    tf.raw_ops.QueueEnqueue(
        handle, components, timeout_ms=-1, name=None
    )
    
The components input has k elements, which correspond to the components of
tuples stored in the given queue.

N.B. If the queue is full, this operation will block until the given element
has been enqueued (or 'timeout_ms' elapses, if specified).

Args  
---  
`handle` |  A `Tensor` of type mutable `string`. The handle to a queue.   
`components` |  A list of `Tensor` objects. One or more tensors from which the enqueued tensors should be taken.   
`timeout_ms` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `-1`. If the queue is full, this operation will block for up to timeout_ms milliseconds. Note: This option is not supported yet.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns
