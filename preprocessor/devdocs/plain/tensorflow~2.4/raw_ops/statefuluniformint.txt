`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.StatefulUniformInt`

    
    tf.raw_ops.StatefulUniformInt(
        resource, algorithm, shape, minval, maxval, name=None
    )
    
The generated values are uniform integers in the range `[minval, maxval)`. The
lower bound `minval` is included in the range, while the upper bound `maxval`
is excluded.

The random integers are slightly biased unless `maxval - minval` is an exact
power of two. The bias is small for values of `maxval - minval` significantly
smaller than the range of the output (either `2^32` or `2^64`).

Args  
---  
`resource` |  A `Tensor` of type `resource`. The handle of the resource variable that stores the state of the RNG.   
`algorithm` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64`. The RNG algorithm.   
`shape` |  A `Tensor`. The shape of the output tensor.   
`minval` |  A `Tensor`. Minimum value (inclusive, scalar).   
`maxval` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `minval`. Maximum value (exclusive, scalar).   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `minval`.
