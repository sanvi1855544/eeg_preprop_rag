or by starting a new tree.

Args  
---  
`tree_ensemble_handle` |  A `Tensor` of type `resource`. Handle to the ensemble variable.   
`feature_ids` |  A list of at least 1 `Tensor` objects with type `int32`. Rank 1 tensor with ids for each feature. This is the real id of the feature that will be used in the split.   
`dimension_ids` |  A list of `Tensor` objects with type `int32`. List of rank 1 tensors representing the dimension in each feature.   
`node_ids` |  A list with the same length as `dimension_ids` of `Tensor` objects with type `int32`. List of rank 1 tensors representing the nodes for which this feature has a split.   
`gains` |  A list with the same length as `dimension_ids` of `Tensor` objects with type `float32`. List of rank 1 tensors representing the gains for each of the feature's split.   
`thresholds` |  A list with the same length as `dimension_ids` of `Tensor` objects with type `int32`. List of rank 1 tensors representing the thesholds for each of the feature's split.   
`left_node_contribs` |  A list with the same length as `dimension_ids` of `Tensor` objects with type `float32`. List of rank 2 tensors with left leaf contribs for each of the feature's splits. Will be added to the previous node values to constitute the values of the left nodes.   
`right_node_contribs` |  A list with the same length as `dimension_ids` of `Tensor` objects with type `float32`. List of rank 2 tensors with right leaf contribs for each of the feature's splits. Will be added to the previous node values to constitute the values of the right nodes.   
`split_types` |  A list with the same length as `dimension_ids` of `Tensor` objects with type `string`. List of rank 1 tensors representing the split type for each feature.   
`max_depth` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. Max depth of the tree to build.   
`learning_rate` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. shrinkage const for each new tree.   
`pruning_mode` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. 0-No pruning, 1-Pre-pruning, 2-Post-pruning.   
`logits_dimension` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `1`. scalar, dimension of the logits   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The created Operation.
