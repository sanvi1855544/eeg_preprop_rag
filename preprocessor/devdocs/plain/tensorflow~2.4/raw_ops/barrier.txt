`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Barrier`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Barrier(
        component_types, shapes=[], capacity=-1, container='',
        shared_name='', name=None
    )
    
A barrier represents a key-value map, where each key is a string, and each
value is a tuple of tensors.

At runtime, the barrier contains 'complete' and 'incomplete' elements. A
complete element has defined tensors for all components of its value tuple,
and may be accessed using BarrierTakeMany. An incomplete element has some
undefined components in its value tuple, and may be updated using
BarrierInsertMany.

Args  
---  
`component_types` |  A list of `tf.DTypes` that has length `>= 1`. The type of each component in a value.   
`shapes` |  An optional list of shapes (each a `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`). Defaults to `[]`. The shape of each component in a value. Each shape must be 1 in the first dimension. The length of this attr must be the same as the length of component_types.   
`capacity` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `-1`. The capacity of the barrier. The default capacity is MAX_INT32, which is the largest capacity of the underlying queue.   
`container` |  An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`. If non-empty, this barrier is placed in the given container. Otherwise, a default container is used.   
`shared_name` |  An optional `string`. Defaults to `""`. If non-empty, this barrier will be shared under the given name across multiple sessions.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type mutable `string`.
