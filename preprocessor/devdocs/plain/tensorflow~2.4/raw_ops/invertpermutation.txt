`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.InvertPermutation`

    
    tf.raw_ops.InvertPermutation(
        x, name=None
    )
    
This operation computes the inverse of an index permutation. It takes a 1-D
integer tensor `x`, which represents the indices of a zero-based array, and
swaps each value with its index position. In other words, for an output tensor
`y` and an input tensor `x`, this operation computes the following:

`y[x[i]] = i for i in [0, 1, ..., len(x) - 1]`

The values must include 0. There can be no duplicate values or negative
values.

#### For example:

    
    # tensor `x` is [3, 4, 0, 2, 1]
    invert_permutation(x) ==> [2, 4, 3, 0, 1]
    
Args  
---  
`x` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. 1-D.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.
