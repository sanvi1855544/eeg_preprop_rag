`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.CombinedNonMaxSuppression`

    
    tf.raw_ops.CombinedNonMaxSuppression(
        boxes, scores, max_output_size_per_class, max_total_size, iou_threshold,
        score_threshold, pad_per_class=False, clip_boxes=True, name=None
    )
    
This operation performs non_max_suppression on the inputs per batch, across
all classes. Prunes away boxes that have high intersection-over-union (IOU)
overlap with previously selected boxes. Bounding boxes are supplied as [y1,
x1, y2, x2], where (y1, x1) and (y2, x2) are the coordinates of any diagonal
pair of box corners and the coordinates can be provided as normalized (i.e.,
lying in the interval [0, 1]) or absolute. Note that this algorithm is
agnostic to where the origin is in the coordinate system. Also note that this
algorithm is invariant to orthogonal transformations and translations of the
coordinate system; thus translating or reflections of the coordinate system
result in the same boxes being selected by the algorithm. The output of this
operation is the final boxes, scores and classes tensor returned after
performing non_max_suppression.

Args  
---  
`boxes` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. A 4-D float tensor of shape `[batch_size, num_boxes, q, 4]`. If `q` is 1 then same boxes are used for all classes otherwise, if `q` is equal to number of classes, class-specific boxes are used.   
`scores` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. A 3-D float tensor of shape `[batch_size, num_boxes, num_classes]` representing a single score corresponding to each box (each row of boxes).   
`max_output_size_per_class` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. A scalar integer tensor representing the maximum number of boxes to be selected by non max suppression per class   
`max_total_size` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. A scalar representing maximum number of boxes retained over all classes.   
`iou_threshold` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. A 0-D float tensor representing the threshold for deciding whether boxes overlap too much with respect to IOU.   
`score_threshold` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. A 0-D float tensor representing the threshold for deciding when to remove boxes based on score.   
`pad_per_class` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If false, the output nmsed boxes, scores and classes are padded/clipped to `max_total_size`. If true, the output nmsed boxes, scores and classes are padded to be of length `max_size_per_class`*`num_classes`, unless it exceeds `max_total_size` in which case it is clipped to `max_total_size`. Defaults to false.   
`clip_boxes` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`. If true, assume the box coordinates are between [0, 1] and clip the output boxes if they fall beyond [0, 1]. If false, do not do clipping and output the box coordinates as it is.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (nmsed_boxes, nmsed_scores, nmsed_classes,
valid_detections).  
`nmsed_boxes` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`.   
`nmsed_scores` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`.   
`nmsed_classes` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`.   
`valid_detections` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`.
