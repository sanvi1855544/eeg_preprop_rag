`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.FusedBatchNormV2`

    
    tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNormV2(
        x, scale, offset, mean, variance, epsilon=0.0001, exponential_avg_factor=1,
        data_format='NHWC', is_training=True, name=None
    )
    
Note that the size of 4D Tensors are defined by either "NHWC" or "NCHW". The
size of 1D Tensors matches the dimension C of the 4D Tensors.

Args  
---  
`x` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `bfloat16`, `float32`. A 4D Tensor for input data.   
`scale` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`. A 1D Tensor for scaling factor, to scale the normalized x.   
`offset` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `scale`. A 1D Tensor for offset, to shift to the normalized x.   
`mean` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `scale`. A 1D Tensor for population mean. Used for inference only; must be empty for training.   
`variance` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `scale`. A 1D Tensor for population variance. Used for inference only; must be empty for training.   
`epsilon` |  An optional `float`. Defaults to `0.0001`. A small float number added to the variance of x.   
`exponential_avg_factor` |  An optional `float`. Defaults to `1`.   
`data_format` |  An optional `string` from: `"NHWC", "NCHW"`. Defaults to `"NHWC"`. The data format for x and y. Either "NHWC" (default) or "NCHW".   
`is_training` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`. A bool value to indicate the operation is for training (default) or inference.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (y, batch_mean, batch_variance, reserve_space_1,
reserve_space_2).  
`y` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.   
`batch_mean` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `scale`.   
`batch_variance` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `scale`.   
`reserve_space_1` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `scale`.   
`reserve_space_2` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `scale`.
