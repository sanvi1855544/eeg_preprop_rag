`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Squeeze`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Squeeze(
        input, axis=[], name=None
    )
    
Given a tensor `input`, this operation returns a tensor of the same type with
all dimensions of size 1 removed. If you don't want to remove all size 1
dimensions, you can remove specific size 1 dimensions by specifying `axis`.

#### For example:

    
    # 't' is a tensor of shape [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1]
    shape(squeeze(t)) ==> [2, 3]
    
Or, to remove specific size 1 dimensions:

    
    # 't' is a tensor of shape [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1]
    shape(squeeze(t, [2, 4])) ==> [1, 2, 3, 1]
    
Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. The `input` to squeeze.   
`axis` |  An optional list of `ints`. Defaults to `[]`. If specified, only squeezes the dimensions listed. The dimension index starts at 0. It is an error to squeeze a dimension that is not 1. Must be in the range `[-rank(input), rank(input))`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
