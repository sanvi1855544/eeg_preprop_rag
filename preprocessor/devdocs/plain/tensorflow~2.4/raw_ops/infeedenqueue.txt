`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.InfeedEnqueue`

    
    tf.raw_ops.InfeedEnqueue(
        input, shape=[], layout=[], device_ordinal=-1, name=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. A tensor that will be provided using the infeed mechanism.   
`shape` |  An optional `tf.TensorShape` or list of `ints`. Defaults to `[]`. The shape of the tensor.   
`layout` |  An optional list of `ints`. Defaults to `[]`. A vector holding the requested layout in minor-to-major sequence. If a layout attribute is passed, but its values are all -1, the layout will be computed by the infeed operation.   
`device_ordinal` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `-1`. The TPU device to use. This should be -1 when the Op is running on a TPU device, and >= 0 when the Op is running on the CPU device.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The created Operation.
