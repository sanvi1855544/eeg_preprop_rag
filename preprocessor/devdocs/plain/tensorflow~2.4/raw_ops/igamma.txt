`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Igamma`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Igamma(
        a, x, name=None
    )
    
The lower regularized incomplete Gamma function is defined as:

\\(P(a, x) = gamma(a, x) / Gamma(a) = 1 - Q(a, x)\\)

where

\\(gamma(a, x) = \\\int_{0}^{x} t^{a-1} exp(-t) dt\\)

is the lower incomplete Gamma function.

Note, above `Q(a, x)` (`Igammac`) is the upper regularized complete Gamma
function.

Args  
---  
`a` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`.   
`x` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `a`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `a`.
