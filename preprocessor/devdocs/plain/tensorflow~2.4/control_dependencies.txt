When eager execution is enabled, any callable object in the `control_inputs` list will be called. | Args  
---  
`control_inputs` |  A list of `Operation` or `Tensor` objects which must be executed or computed before running the operations defined in the context. Can also be `None` to clear the control dependencies. If eager execution is enabled, any callable object in the `control_inputs` list will be called.   
Returns  
---  
A context manager that specifies control dependencies for all operations
constructed within the context.
