        values, axis=-1, direction='ASCENDING', name=None
    )
    
#### Usage:

    
    import tensorflow as tf
    a = [1, 10, 26.9, 2.8, 166.32, 62.3]
    b = tf.sort(a,axis=-1,direction='ASCENDING',name=None)
    c = tf.keras.backend.eval(b)
    # Here, c = [  1.     2.8   10.    26.9   62.3  166.32]
    
| Args  
---  
`values` |  1-D or higher numeric `Tensor`.   
`axis` |  The axis along which to sort. The default is -1, which sorts the last axis.   
`direction` |  The direction in which to sort the values (`'ASCENDING'` or `'DESCENDING'`).   
`name` |  Optional name for the operation.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` with the same dtype and shape as `values`, with the elements sorted
along the given `axis`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If axis is not a constant scalar, or the direction is invalid.
