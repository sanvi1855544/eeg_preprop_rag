`tf.compat.v1.VariableSynchronization`

  * `AUTO`: Indicates that the synchronization will be determined by the current `DistributionStrategy` (eg. With `MirroredStrategy` this would be `ON_WRITE`).
  * `NONE`: Indicates that there will only be one copy of the variable, so there is no need to sync.
  * `ON_WRITE`: Indicates that the variable will be updated across devices every time it is written.
  * `ON_READ`: Indicates that the variable will be aggregated across devices when it is read (eg. when checkpointing or when evaluating an op that uses the variable).
