# tf.autograph.to_code

View source on GitHub  Returns the source code generated by AutoGraph, as a
string.

    
    tf.autograph.to_code(
        entity, recursive=True, experimental_optional_features=None
    )
    
#### Example usage:

    
    def f(x):
      if x < 0:
        x = -x
      return x
    tf.autograph.to_code(f)
    "...def tf__f(x):..."
    
Also see: `tf.autograph.to_graph`.

> Note: If a function has been decorated with `tf.function`, pass its
> underlying Python function, rather than the callable that `tf.function
> creates:
    
    @tf.function
    def f(x):
      if x < 0:
        x = -x
      return x
    tf.autograph.to_code(f.python_function)
    "...def tf__f(x):..."
    
| Args  
---  
`entity` |  Python callable or class to convert.   
`recursive` |  Whether to recursively convert any functions that the converted function may call.   
`experimental_optional_features` |  `None`, a tuple of, or a single `tf.autograph.experimental.Feature` value.   
Returns  
---  
The converted code as string.
