# tf.autograph.to_graph

View source on GitHub  Converts a Python entity into a TensorFlow graph.

    
    tf.autograph.to_graph(
        entity, recursive=True, experimental_optional_features=None
    )
    
Also see: `tf.autograph.to_code`, `tf.function`. Unlike `tf.function`,
`to_graph` is a low-level transpiler that converts Python code to TensorFlow
graph code. It does not implement any caching, variable management or create
any actual ops, and is best used where greater control over the generated
TensorFlow graph is desired. Another difference from `tf.function` is that
`to_graph` will not wrap the graph into a TensorFlow function or a Python
callable. Internally, `tf.function` uses `to_graph`.

#### Example usage:

    
    def f(x):
      if x > 0:
        y = x * x
      else:
        y = -x
      return y
    
    converted_f = to_graph(f)
    x = tf.constant(2)
    converted_f(x)  # converted_foo is like a TensorFlow Op.
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=int32, numpy=4>
    
Supported Python entities include:

  * functions
  * classes
  * object methods

Functions are converted into new functions with converted code. Classes are converted by generating a new class whose methods use converted code. Methods are converted into unbound function that have an additional first argument called `self`. For a tutorial, see the tf.function and AutoGraph guide. For more detailed information, see the AutoGraph reference documentation. | Args  
---  
`entity` |  Python callable or class to convert.   
`recursive` |  Whether to recursively convert any functions that the converted function may call.   
`experimental_optional_features` |  `None`, a tuple of, or a single `tf.autograph.experimental.Feature` value.   
Returns  
---  
Same as `entity`, the converted Python function or class.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the entity could not be converted.
