`tf.compat.v1.autograph.experimental.Feature` These conversion options are
experimental. They are subject to change without notice and offer no
guarantees. Example Usage

    
    optionals= tf.autograph.experimental.Feature.EQUALITY_OPERATORS
    @tf.function(experimental_autograph_options=optionals)
    def f(i):
      if i == 0:  # EQUALITY_OPERATORS allows the use of == here.
        tf.print('i is zero')
    
| Attributes  
---  
`ALL` |  Enable all features.   
`AUTO_CONTROL_DEPS` |  Insert of control dependencies in the generated code.   
`ASSERT_STATEMENTS` |  Convert Tensor-dependent assert statements to tf.Assert.   
`BUILTIN_FUNCTIONS` |  Convert builtin functions applied to Tensors to their TF counterparts.   
`EQUALITY_OPERATORS` |  Whether to convert the comparison operators, like equality. This is soon to be deprecated as support is being added to the Tensor class.   
`LISTS` |  Convert list idioms, like initializers, slices, append, etc.   
`NAME_SCOPES` |  Insert name scopes that name ops according to context, like the function they were defined in.
