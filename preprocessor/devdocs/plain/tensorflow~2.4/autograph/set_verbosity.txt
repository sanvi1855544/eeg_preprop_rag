`tf.compat.v1.autograph.set_verbosity`

    
    tf.autograph.set_verbosity(
        level, alsologtostdout=False
    )
    
Debug logging in AutoGraph More verbose logging is useful to enable when
filing bug reports or doing more in-depth debugging. There are two means to
control the logging verbosity:

  * The `set_verbosity` function
  * The `AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY` environment variable

`set_verbosity` takes precedence over the environment variable.

#### For example:

    
    import os
    import tensorflow as tf
    
    os.environ['AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY'] = 5
    # Verbosity is now 5
    
    tf.autograph.set_verbosity(0)
    # Verbosity is now 0
    
    os.environ['AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY'] = 1
    # No effect, because set_verbosity was already called.
    
Logs entries are output to absl's default output, with `INFO` level. Logs can be mirrored to stdout by using the `alsologtostdout` argument. Mirroring is enabled by default when Python runs in interactive mode. | Args  
---  
`level` |  int, the verbosity level; larger values specify increased verbosity; 0 means no logging. When reporting bugs, it is recommended to set this value to a larger number, like 10.   
`alsologtostdout` |  bool, whether to also output log messages to `sys.stdout`.
