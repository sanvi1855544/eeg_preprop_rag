`tf.compat.v1.rank`

    
    tf.rank(
        input, name=None
    )
    
See also `tf.shape`. Returns a 0-D `int32` `Tensor` representing the rank of
`input`.

#### For example:

    
    # shape of tensor 't' is [2, 2, 3]
    t = tf.constant([[[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]], [[3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4]]])
    tf.rank(t)  # 3
    
> Note: The rank of a tensor is not the same as the rank of a matrix. The rank
> of a tensor is the number of indices required to uniquely select each
> element of the tensor. Rank is also known as "order", "degree", or "ndims."
| Args

`input` |  A `Tensor` or `SparseTensor`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).

---  
A `Tensor` of type `int32`.
