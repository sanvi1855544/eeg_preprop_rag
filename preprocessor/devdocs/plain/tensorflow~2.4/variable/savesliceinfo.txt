`tf.compat.v1.Variable.SaveSliceInfo`

    
    tf.Variable.SaveSliceInfo(
        full_name=None, full_shape=None, var_offset=None, var_shape=None,
        save_slice_info_def=None, import_scope=None
    )
    
Provides internal support for saving variables as slices of a larger variable.
This API is not public and is subject to change.

#### Available properties:

  * full_name
  * full_shape
  * var_offset
  * var_shape

| Args  
---  
`full_name` |  Name of the full variable of which this `Variable` is a slice.   
`full_shape` |  Shape of the full variable, as a list of int.   
`var_offset` |  Offset of this `Variable` into the full variable, as a list of int.   
`var_shape` |  Shape of this `Variable`, as a list of int.   
`save_slice_info_def` |  `SaveSliceInfoDef` protocol buffer. If not `None`, recreates the SaveSliceInfo object its contents. `save_slice_info_def` and other arguments are mutually exclusive.   
`import_scope` |  Optional `string`. Name scope to add. Only used when initializing from protocol buffer.   
Attributes  
---  
`spec` |  Computes the spec string used for saving.

### `to_proto`

Args  
---  
`export_scope` |  Optional `string`. Name scope to remove.   
Returns  
---  
A `SaveSliceInfoDef` protocol buffer, or None if the `Variable` is not in the
