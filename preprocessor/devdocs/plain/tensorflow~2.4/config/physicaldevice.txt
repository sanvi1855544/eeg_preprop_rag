`tf.compat.v1.config.PhysicalDevice`

    
    tf.config.PhysicalDevice(
        name, device_type
    )
    
TensorFlow can utilize various devices such as the CPU or multiple GPUs for
computation. Before initializing a local device for use, the user can
customize certain properties of the device such as it's visibility or memory
configuration.

Once a visible `tf.config.PhysicalDevice` is initialized one or more
`tf.config.LogicalDevice` objects are created. Use
`tf.config.set_visible_devices` to configure the visibility of a physical
device and `tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration` to configure multiple
`tf.config.LogicalDevice` objects for a `tf.config.PhysicalDevice`. This is
useful when separation between models is needed or to simulate a multi-device
environment.

#### Fields:

  * `name`: Unique identifier for device.
  * `device_type`: String declaring the type of device such as "CPU" or "GPU".
