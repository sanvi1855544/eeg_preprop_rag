    tf.config.list_logical_devices(
        device_type=None
    )
    
Logical devices may correspond to physical devices or remote devices in the
cluster. Operations and tensors may be placed on these devices by using the
`name` of the `tf.config.LogicalDevice`.

Calling `tf.config.list_logical_devices` triggers the runtime to configure any
`tf.config.PhysicalDevice` visible to the runtime, thereby preventing further
configuration. To avoid runtime initialization, call
`tf.config.list_physical_devices` instead.

#### For example:

    
    logical_devices = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
    if len(logical_devices) > 0:
      # Allocate on GPU:0
      with tf.device(logical_devices[0].name):
        one = tf.constant(1)
      # Allocate on GPU:1
      with tf.device(logical_devices[1].name):
        two = tf.constant(2)
    
Args  
---  
`device_type` |  (optional string) Only include devices matching this device type. For example "CPU" or "GPU".   
Returns
