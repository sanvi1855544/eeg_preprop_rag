    tf.config.get_visible_devices(
        device_type=None
    )
    
Returns the list of `PhysicalDevice`s currently marked as visible to the
runtime. A visible device will have at least one `LogicalDevice` associated
with it once the runtime is initialized.

The following example verifies all visible GPUs have been disabled:

    
    physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    try:
      # Disable all GPUS
      tf.config.set_visible_devices([], 'GPU')
      visible_devices = tf.config.get_visible_devices()
      for device in visible_devices:
        assert device.device_type != 'GPU'
    except:
      # Invalid device or cannot modify virtual devices once initialized.
      pass
    
Args  
---  
`device_type` |  (optional string) Only include devices matching this device type. For example "CPU" or "GPU".   
Returns  
---
