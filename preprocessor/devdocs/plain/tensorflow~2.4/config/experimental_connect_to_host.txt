`tf.compat.v1.config.experimental_connect_to_host`

    
    tf.config.experimental_connect_to_host(
        remote_host=None, job_name='worker'
    )
    
Will make devices on the remote host available to use. Note that calling this
more than once will work, but will invalidate any tensor handles on the old
remote devices. Using the default job_name of worker, you can schedule ops to
run remotely as follows:

    
    # When eager execution is enabled, connect to the remote host.
    tf.config.experimental_connect_to_host("exampleaddr.com:9876")
    
    with ops.device("job:worker/replica:0/task:1/device:CPU:0"):
      # The following tensors should be resident on the remote device, and the op
      # will also execute remotely.
      x1 = array_ops.ones([2, 2])
      x2 = array_ops.ones([2, 2])
      y = math_ops.matmul(x1, x2)
