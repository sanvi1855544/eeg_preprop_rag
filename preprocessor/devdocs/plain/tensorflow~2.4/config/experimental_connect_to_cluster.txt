`tf.compat.v1.config.experimental_connect_to_cluster`

    
    tf.config.experimental_connect_to_cluster(
        cluster_spec_or_resolver, job_name='localhost', task_index=0,
        protocol=None, make_master_device_default=True, cluster_device_filters=None
    )
    
Will make devices on the cluster available to use. Note that calling this more
than once will work, but will invalidate any tensor handles on the old remote
devices. If the given local job name is not present in the cluster
specification, it will be automatically added, using an unused port on the
localhost. Device filters can be specified to isolate groups of remote tasks
to avoid undesired accesses between workers. Workers accessing resources or
launching ops / functions on filtered remote devices will result in errors
(unknown devices). For any remote task, if no device filter is present, all
cluster devices will be visible; if any device filter is specified, it can
only see devices matching at least one filter. Devices on the task itself are
always visible. Device filters can be particially specified. For example, for
a cluster set up for parameter server training, the following device filters
might be specified:

    
    cdf = tf.config.experimental.ClusterDeviceFilters()
    # For any worker, only the devices on PS nodes and itself are visible
    for i in range(num_workers):
      cdf.set_device_filters('worker', i, ['/job:ps'])
    # Similarly for any ps, only the devices on workers and itself are visible
    for i in range(num_ps):
      cdf.set_device_filters('ps', i, ['/job:worker'])
    
    tf.config.experimental_connect_to_cluster(cluster_def,
                                              cluster_device_filters=cdf)
    
| Args  
---  
`cluster_spec_or_resolver` |  A `ClusterSpec` or `ClusterResolver` describing the cluster.   
`job_name` |  The name of the local job.   
`task_index` |  The local task index.   
`protocol` |  The communication protocol, such as `"grpc"`. If unspecified, will use the default from `python/platform/remote_utils.py`.   
`make_master_device_default` |  If True and a cluster resolver is passed, will automatically enter the master task device scope, which indicates the master becomes the default device to run ops. It won't do anything if a cluster spec is passed. Will throw an error if the caller is currently already in some device scope.   
`cluster_device_filters` |  an instance of `tf.train.experimental/ClusterDeviceFilters` that specify device filters to the remote tasks in cluster.
