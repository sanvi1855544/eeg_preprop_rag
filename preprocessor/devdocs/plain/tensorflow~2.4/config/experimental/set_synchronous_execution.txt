    tf.config.experimental.set_synchronous_execution(
        enable
    )
    
TensorFlow can execute operations synchronously or asynchronously. If asynchronous execution is enabled, operations may return "non-ready" handles. When `enable` is set to None, an appropriate value will be picked automatically. The value picked may change between TensorFlow releases. | Args  
---  
`enable` |  Whether operations should be dispatched synchronously. Valid values: 
  * None: sets the system default.
  * True: executes each operation synchronously.
  * False: executes each operation asynchronously.
