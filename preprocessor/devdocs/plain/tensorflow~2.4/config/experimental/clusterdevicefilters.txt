    tf.config.experimental.ClusterDeviceFilters()
    
> Note: this is an experimental API and subject to changes.
Set device filters for selective jobs and tasks. For each remote worker, the
device filters are a list of strings. When any filters are present, the remote
worker will ignore all devices which do not match any of its filters. Each
filter can be partially specified, e.g. "/job:ps", "/job:worker/replica:3",
etc. Note that a device is always visible to the worker it is located on.

For example, to set the device filters for a parameter server cluster:

    
    cdf = tf.config.experimental.ClusterDeviceFilters()
    for i in range(num_workers):
      cdf.set_device_filters('worker', i, ['/job:ps'])
    for i in range(num_ps):
      cdf.set_device_filters('ps', i, ['/job:worker'])
    
    tf.config.experimental_connect_to_cluster(cluster_def,
                                              cluster_device_filters=cdf)
    
The device filters can be partically specified. For remote tasks that do not
have device filters specified, all devices will be visible to them.
