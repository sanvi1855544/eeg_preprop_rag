    tf.config.experimental_run_functions_eagerly(
        run_eagerly
    )
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating: Use `tf.config.run_functions_eagerly` instead of
the experimental version. Calling
`tf.config.experimental_run_functions_eagerly(True)` will make all invocations
of `tf.function` run eagerly instead of running as a traced graph function.
See `tf.config.run_functions_eagerly` for an example.

> Note: This flag has no effect on functions passed into tf.data
> transformations as arguments. tf.data functions are never executed eagerly
> and are always executed as a compiled Tensorflow Graph.
