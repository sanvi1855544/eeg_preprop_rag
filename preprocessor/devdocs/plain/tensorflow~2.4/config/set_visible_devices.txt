    tf.config.set_visible_devices(
        devices, device_type=None
    )
    
Specifies which `PhysicalDevice` objects are visible to the runtime.
TensorFlow will only allocate memory and place operations on visible physical
devices, as otherwise no `LogicalDevice` will be created on them. By default
all discovered devices are marked as visible.

The following example demonstrates disabling the first GPU on the machine.

    
    physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    try:
      # Disable first GPU
      tf.config.set_visible_devices(physical_devices[1:], 'GPU')
      logical_devices = tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')
      # Logical device was not created for first GPU
      assert len(logical_devices) == len(physical_devices) - 1
    except:
      # Invalid device or cannot modify virtual devices once initialized.
      pass
    
Args  
---  
`devices` |  List of `PhysicalDevice`s to make visible   
`device_type` |  (optional) Only configure devices matching this device type. For example "CPU" or "GPU". Other devices will be left unaltered.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If argument validation fails.   
`RuntimeError` |  Runtime is already initialized.
