`tf.compat.v1.distribute.ReductionToOneDevice`

    
    tf.distribute.ReductionToOneDevice(
        reduce_to_device=None, accumulation_fn=None
    )
    
This implementation always copies values to one device to reduce them, then
broadcast reduced values to the destinations. It doesn't support efficient
batching. Here is how you can use `ReductionToOneDevice` in
`tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy`:

    
    strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy(
      cross_device_ops=tf.distribute.ReductionToOneDevice())
    
| Args  
---  
`reduce_to_device` |  the intermediate device to reduce to. If None, reduce to the first device in `destinations` of the `reduce` method.   
`accumulation_fn` |  a function that does accumulation. If None, `tf.math.add_n` is used.   
## Methods

### `batch_reduce`

View source

    
    batch_reduce(
        reduce_op, value_destination_pairs, options=None
    )
    
Reduce values to destinations in batches.

See `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.batch_reduce_to`. This can only be called
in the cross-replica context.

Args  
---  
`reduce_op` |  a `tf.distribute.ReduceOp` specifying how values should be combined.   
`value_destination_pairs` |  a sequence of (value, destinations) pairs. See `tf.distribute.CrossDeviceOps.reduce` for descriptions.   
`options` |  a `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions`. See `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions` for details.   
Returns  
---  
A list of `tf.Tensor` or `tf.distribute.DistributedValues`, one per pair in
`value_destination_pairs`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if `value_destination_pairs` is not an iterable of tuples of `tf.distribute.DistributedValues` and destinations.   
### `broadcast`

View source

    
    broadcast(
        tensor, destinations
    )
    
Broadcast `tensor` to `destinations`.

This can only be called in the cross-replica context.

Args  
---  
`tensor` |  a `tf.Tensor` like object. The value to broadcast.   
`destinations` |  a `tf.distribute.DistributedValues`, a `tf.Variable`, a `tf.Tensor` alike object, or a device string. It specifies the devices to broadcast to. Note that if it's a `tf.Variable`, the value is broadcasted to the devices of that variable, this method doesn't update the variable.   
Returns  
---  
A `tf.Tensor` or `tf.distribute.DistributedValues`.  
### `reduce`

View source

    
    reduce(
        reduce_op, per_replica_value, destinations, options=None
    )
    
Reduce `per_replica_value` to `destinations`.

See `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.reduce_to`. This can only be called in the
cross-replica context.

Args  
---  
`reduce_op` |  a `tf.distribute.ReduceOp` specifying how values should be combined.   
`per_replica_value` |  a `tf.distribute.DistributedValues`, or a `tf.Tensor` like object.   
`destinations` |  a `tf.distribute.DistributedValues`, a `tf.Variable`, a `tf.Tensor` alike object, or a device string. It specifies the devices to reduce to. To perform an all-reduce, pass the same to `value` and `destinations`. Note that if it's a `tf.Variable`, the value is reduced to the devices of that variable, and this method doesn't update the variable.   
`options` |  a `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions`. See `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions` for details.   
Returns  
---  
A `tf.Tensor` or `tf.distribute.DistributedValues`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if per_replica_value can't be converted to a `tf.distribute.DistributedValues` or if destinations is not a string, `tf.Variable` or `tf.distribute.DistributedValues`.
