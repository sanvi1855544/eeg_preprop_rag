# tf.distribute.experimental.partitioners.Partitioner

Partitioner base class: all partitiners inherit from this class.

Partitioners should implement a `__call__` method with the following
signature:

    
    def __call__(self, shape, dtype, axis=0):
      # Partitions the given `shape` and returns the partition results.
      # See docstring of `__call__` method for the format of partition results.
    
## Methods

### `__call__`

View source

    
    __call__(
        shape, dtype, axis=0
    )
    
Partitions the given `shape` and returns the partition results.

Examples of a partitioner that allocates a fixed number of shards:

    
    partitioner = FixedShardsPartitioner(num_shards=2)
    partitions = partitioner(tf.TensorShape([10, 3], tf.float32), axis=0)
    print(partitions) # [2, 0]
    
Args  
---  
`shape` |  a `tf.TensorShape`, the shape to partition.   
`dtype` |  a `tf.dtypes.Dtype` indicating the type of the partition value.   
`axis` |  The axis to partition along. Default: outermost axis.   
Returns  
---  
A list of integers representing the number of partitions on each axis, where
i-th value correponds to i-th axis.
