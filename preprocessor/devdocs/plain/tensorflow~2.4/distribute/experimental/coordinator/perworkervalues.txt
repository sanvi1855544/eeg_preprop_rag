# tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.PerWorkerValues

A container that holds a list of values, one value per worker.

    
    tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.PerWorkerValues(
        values
    )
    
`tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.PerWorkerValues` contains a collection
of values, where each of the value is located one worker respectively, and
upon being used as one of the `args` or `kwargs` of
`tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.ClusterCoordinator.schedule()`, the
value specific to a worker will be passed into the function being executed at
that particular worker.

Currently, the only supported path to create an object of
`tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.PerWorkerValues` is through calling
`iter` on a `ClusterCoordinator.create_per_worker_dataset`-returned
distributed dataset instance. The mechanism to create a custom
`tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.PerWorkerValues` is not yet supported.
