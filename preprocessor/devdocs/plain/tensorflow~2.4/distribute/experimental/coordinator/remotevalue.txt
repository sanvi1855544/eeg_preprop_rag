# tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.RemoteValue

An asynchronously available value of a scheduled function.

This class is used as the return value of
`tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.ClusterCoordinator.schedule` where the
underlying value becomes available at a later time once the function has been
executed.

Using `tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.RemoteValue` as an input to a
subsequent function scheduled with
`tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.ClusterCoordinator.schedule` is
currently not supported.

#### Example:

    
    strategy = tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy(
        cluster_resolver=...)
    coordinator = (
        tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.ClusterCoordinator(strategy))
    
    with strategy.scope():
      v1 = tf.Variable(initial_value=0.0)
      v2 = tf.Variable(initial_value=1.0)
    
    @tf.function
    def worker_fn():
      v1.assign_add(0.1)
      v2.assign_sub(0.2)
      return v1.read_value() / v2.read_value()
    
    result = coordinator.schedule(worker_fn)
    # Note that `fetch()` gives the actual result instead of a `tf.Tensor`.
    assert result.fetch() == 0.125
    
    for _ in range(10):
      # `worker_fn` will be run on arbitrary workers that are available. The
      # `result` value will be available later.
      result = coordinator.schedule(worker_fn)
    
## Methods

### `fetch`

View source

    
    fetch()
    
Wait for the result of `RemoteValue` to be ready and return the result.

This makes the value concrete by copying the remote value to local.

Returns  
---  
The actual output of the `tf.function` associated with this `RemoteValue`,
previously by a
`tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.ClusterCoordinator.schedule` call.
This can be a single value, or a structure of values, depending on the output
of the `tf.function`.  
Raises  
---  
`tf.errors.CancelledError` |  If the function that produces this `RemoteValue` is aborted or cancelled due to failure.
