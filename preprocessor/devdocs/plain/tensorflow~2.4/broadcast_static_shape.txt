    tf.broadcast_static_shape(
        shape_x, shape_y
    )
    
When `shape_x` and `shape_y` are fully known `TensorShape`s this computes a
`TensorShape` which is the shape of the result of a broadcasting op applied in
tensors of shapes `shape_x` and `shape_y`. For example, if shape_x is
`TensorShape([1, 2, 3])` and shape_y is `TensorShape([5, 1, 3])`, the result
is a TensorShape whose value is `TensorShape([5, 2, 3])`. This is useful when
validating the result of a broadcasting operation when the tensors have
statically known shapes.

#### Example:

    
    shape_x = tf.TensorShape([1, 2, 3])
    shape_y = tf.TensorShape([5, 1 ,3])
    tf.broadcast_static_shape(shape_x, shape_y)
    TensorShape([5, 2, 3])
    
| Args  
---  
`shape_x` |  A `TensorShape`  
`shape_y` |  A `TensorShape`  
Returns  
---  
A `TensorShape` representing the broadcasted shape.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the two shapes can not be broadcasted.
