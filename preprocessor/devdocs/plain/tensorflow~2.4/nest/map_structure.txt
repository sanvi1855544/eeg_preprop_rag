a new structure.

    tf.nest.map_structure(
        func, *structure, **kwargs
    )
    
Applies `func(x[0], x[1], ...)` where x[i] is an entry in `structure[i]`. All
structures in `structure` must have the same arity, and the return value will
contain results with the same structure layout.

#### Examples:

  1. A single Python dict:

    
    a = {"hello": 24, "world": 76}
    tf.nest.map_structure(lambda p: p * 2, a)
    {'hello': 48, 'world': 152}
    
  1. Multiple Python dictionaries:

    
    d1 = {"hello": 24, "world": 76}
    d2 = {"hello": 36, "world": 14}
    tf.nest.map_structure(lambda p1, p2: p1 + p2, d1, d2)
    {'hello': 60, 'world': 90}
    
| Args  
---  
`func` |  A callable that accepts as many arguments as there are structures.   
`*structure` |  scalar, or tuple or dict or list of constructed scalars and/or other tuples/lists, or scalars. Note: numpy arrays are considered as scalars.   
`**kwargs` |  Valid keyword args are: 
  * `check_types`: If set to `True` (default) the types of iterables within the structures have to be same (e.g. `map_structure(func, [1], (1,))` raises a `TypeError` exception). To allow this set this argument to `False`. Note that namedtuples with identical name and fields are always considered to have the same shallow structure.
  * `expand_composites`: If set to `True`, then composite tensors such as `tf.sparse.SparseTensor` and `tf.RaggedTensor` are expanded into their component tensors. If `False` (the default), then composite tensors are not expanded. 

  
Returns  
---  
A new structure with the same arity as `structure`, whose values correspond to
`func(x[0], x[1], ...)` where `x[i]` is a value in the corresponding location
in `structure[i]`. If there are different sequence types and `check_types` is
`False` the sequence types of the first structure will be used.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `func` is not callable or if the structures do not match each other by depth tree.   
`ValueError` |  If no structure is provided or if the structures do not match each other by type.   
`ValueError` |  If wrong keyword arguments are provided.
