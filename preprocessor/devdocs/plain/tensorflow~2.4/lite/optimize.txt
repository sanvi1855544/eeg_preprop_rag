`tf.compat.v1.lite.Optimize` Some optimizations may come at the cost of
accuracy. DEFAULT Default optimization strategy.

    
    Converter will do its best to improve size and latency based on the
    information provided.
    Enhanced optimizations are gained by providing a representative_dataset.
    This is recommended, and is currently equivalent to the modes below.
    Currently, weights will be quantized and if representative_dataset is
    provided, activations for quantizable operations will also be quantized.
