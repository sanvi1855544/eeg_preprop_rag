# tf.debugging.assert_positive

View source on GitHub  Assert the condition `x > 0` holds element-wise.

    
    tf.debugging.assert_positive(
        x, message=None, summarize=None, name=None
    )
    
This Op checks that `x[i] > 0` holds for every element of `x`. If `x` is empty, this is trivially satisfied. If `x` is not positive everywhere, `message`, as well as the first `summarize` entries of `x` are printed, and `InvalidArgumentError` is raised. | Args  
---  
`x` |  Numeric `Tensor`.   
`message` |  A string to prefix to the default message.   
`summarize` |  Print this many entries of each tensor.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional). Defaults to "assert_positive".   
Returns  
---  
Op raising `InvalidArgumentError` unless `x` is all positive. This can be used
with `tf.control_dependencies` inside of `tf.function`s to block followup
computation until the check has executed.  
Raises  
---  
`InvalidArgumentError` |  if the check can be performed immediately and `x[i] > 0` is False. The check can be performed immediately during eager execution or if `x` is statically known.
