# tf.debugging.assert_shapes

View source on GitHub  Assert tensor shapes and dimension size relationships
between tensors.

    
    tf.debugging.assert_shapes(
        shapes, data=None, summarize=None, message=None, name=None
    )
    
This Op checks that a collection of tensors shape relationships satisfies
given constraints.

#### Example:

    
    n = 10
    q = 3
    d = 7
    x = tf.zeros([n,q])
    y = tf.ones([n,d])
    param = tf.Variable([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    scalar = 1.0
    tf.debugging.assert_shapes([
     (x, ('N', 'Q')),
     (y, ('N', 'D')),
     (param, ('Q',)),
     (scalar, ()),
    ])
    
    
    tf.debugging.assert_shapes([
      (x, ('N', 'D')),
      (y, ('N', 'D'))
    ])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    
    ValueError: ...
    
If `x`, `y`, `param` or `scalar` does not have a shape that satisfies all
specified constraints, `message`, as well as the first `summarize` entries of
the first encountered violating tensor are printed, and `InvalidArgumentError`
is raised. Size entries in the specified shapes are checked against other
entries by their hash, except:

  * a size entry is interpreted as an explicit size if it can be parsed as an integer primitive.
  * a size entry is interpreted as any size if it is None or '.'.

If the first entry of a shape is `...` (type `Ellipsis`) or '*' that indicates a variable number of outer dimensions of unspecified size, i.e. the constraint applies to the inner-most dimensions only. Scalar tensors and specified shapes of length zero (excluding the 'inner-most' prefix) are both treated as having a single dimension of size one. | Args  
---  
`shapes` |  dictionary with (`Tensor` to shape) items, or a list of (`Tensor`, shape) tuples. A shape must be an iterable.   
`data` |  The tensors to print out if the condition is False. Defaults to error message and first few entries of the violating tensor.   
`summarize` |  Print this many entries of the tensor.   
`message` |  A string to prefix to the default message.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional). Defaults to "assert_shapes".   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If static checks determine any shape constraint is violated.
