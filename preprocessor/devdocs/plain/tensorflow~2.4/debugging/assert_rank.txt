    tf.debugging.assert_rank(
        x, rank, message=None, name=None
    )
    
This Op checks that the rank of `x` is equal to `rank`. If `x` has a different rank, `message`, as well as the shape of `x` are printed, and `InvalidArgumentError` is raised. | Args  
---  
`x` |  `Tensor`.   
`rank` |  Scalar integer `Tensor`.   
`message` |  A string to prefix to the default message.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional). Defaults to "assert_rank".   
Returns  
---  
Op raising `InvalidArgumentError` unless `x` has specified rank. If static
checks determine `x` has correct rank, a `no_op` is returned. This can be used
with `tf.control_dependencies` inside of `tf.function`s to block followup
computation until the check has executed.  
Raises  
---  
`InvalidArgumentError` |  if the check can be performed immediately and `x` does not have rank `rank`. The check can be performed immediately during eager execution or if the shape of `x` is statically known.
