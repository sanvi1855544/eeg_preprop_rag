`tf.compat.v1.debugging.experimental.disable_dump_debug_info`

    
    tf.debugging.experimental.disable_dump_debug_info()
    
If the `enable_dump_debug_info()` method under the same Python namespace has
been invoked before, calling this method disables it. If no call to
`enable_dump_debug_info()` has been made, calling this method is a no-op.
Calling this method more than once is idempotent.
