`tf.compat.v1.debugging.disable_check_numerics`

    
    tf.debugging.disable_check_numerics()
    
This method can be used after a call to `tf.debugging.enable_check_numerics()`
to disable the numerics-checking mechanism that catches infinity and NaN
values output by ops executed eagerly or in tf.function-compiled graphs.

This method is idempotent. Calling it multiple times has the same effect as
calling it once.

This method takes effect only on the thread in which it is called.
