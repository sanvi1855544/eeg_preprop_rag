    tf.debugging.assert_scalar(
        tensor, message=None, name=None
    )
    
This function raises `ValueError` unless it can be certain that the given `tensor` is a scalar. `ValueError` is also raised if the shape of `tensor` is unknown. This is always checked statically, so this method returns nothing. | Args  
---  
`tensor` |  A `Tensor`.   
`message` |  A string to prefix to the default message.   
`name` |  A name for this operation. Defaults to "assert_scalar"   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the tensor is not scalar (rank 0), or if its shape is unknown.
