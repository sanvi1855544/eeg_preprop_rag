    tf.debugging.assert_equal(
        x, y, message=None, summarize=None, name=None
    )
    
This Op checks that `x[i] == y[i]` holds for every pair of (possibly broadcast) elements of `x` and `y`. If both `x` and `y` are empty, this is trivially satisfied. If `x` and `y` are not equal, `message`, as well as the first `summarize` entries of `x` and `y` are printed, and `InvalidArgumentError` is raised. | Args  
---  
`x` |  Numeric `Tensor`.   
`y` |  Numeric `Tensor`, same dtype as and broadcastable to `x`.   
`message` |  A string to prefix to the default message.   
`summarize` |  Print this many entries of each tensor.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional). Defaults to "assert_equal".   
Returns  
---  
Op that raises `InvalidArgumentError` if `x == y` is False. This can be used
with `tf.control_dependencies` inside of `tf.function`s to block followup
computation until the check has executed.  
Raises  
---  
`InvalidArgumentError` |  if the check can be performed immediately and `x == y` is False. The check can be performed immediately during eager execution or if `x` and `y` are statically known.
