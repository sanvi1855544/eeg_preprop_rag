# tf.squeeze

View source on GitHub  Removes dimensions of size 1 from the shape of a
tensor.

    
    tf.squeeze(
        input, axis=None, name=None
    )
    
Given a tensor `input`, this operation returns a tensor of the same type with
all dimensions of size 1 removed. If you don't want to remove all size 1
dimensions, you can remove specific size 1 dimensions by specifying `axis`.

#### For example:

    
    # 't' is a tensor of shape [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1]
    tf.shape(tf.squeeze(t))  # [2, 3]
    
Or, to remove specific size 1 dimensions:

    
    # 't' is a tensor of shape [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1]
    tf.shape(tf.squeeze(t, [2, 4]))  # [1, 2, 3, 1]
    
Unlike the older op `tf.compat.v1.squeeze`, this op does not accept a
deprecated `squeeze_dims` argument.

> Note: if `input` is a `tf.RaggedTensor`, then this operation takes `O(N)`
> time, where `N` is the number of elements in the squeezed dimensions.
| Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. The `input` to squeeze.   
`axis` |  An optional list of `ints`. Defaults to `[]`. If specified, only squeezes the dimensions listed. The dimension index starts at 0. It is an error to squeeze a dimension that is not 1. Must be in the range `[-rank(input), rank(input))`. Must be specified if `input` is a `RaggedTensor`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`. Contains the same data as `input`,
but has one or more dimensions of size 1 removed.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  The input cannot be converted to a tensor, or the specified axis cannot be squeezed.
