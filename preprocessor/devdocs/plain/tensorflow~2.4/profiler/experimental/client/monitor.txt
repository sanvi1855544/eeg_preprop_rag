# tf.profiler.experimental.client.monitor

Sends grpc requests to profiler server to perform on-demand monitoring.

    
    tf.profiler.experimental.client.monitor(
        service_addr, duration_ms, level=1
    )
    
The monitoring result is a light weight performance summary of your model
execution. This method will block the caller thread until it receives the
monitoring result. This method currently supports Cloud TPU only.

Args  
---  
`service_addr` |  gRPC address of profiler service e.g. grpc://10.0.0.2:8466.   
`duration_ms` |  Duration of monitoring in ms.   
`level` |  Choose a monitoring level between 1 and 2 to monitor your job. Level 2 is more verbose than level 1 and shows more metrics.   
Returns  
---  
A string of monitoring output.  
#### Example usage:

    
    # Continuously send gRPC requests to the Cloud TPU to monitor the model
    # execution.
    
    for query in range(0, 100):
      print(
        tf.profiler.experimental.client.monitor('grpc://10.0.0.2:8466', 1000))
