# xmlrpc — XMLRPC server and client modules

XML-RPC is a Remote Procedure Call method that uses XML passed via HTTP as a
transport. With it, a client can call methods with parameters on a remote
server (the server is named by a URI) and get back structured data.

`xmlrpc` is a package that collects server and client modules implementing
XML-RPC. The modules are:

  * `xmlrpc.client`
  * `xmlrpc.server`
