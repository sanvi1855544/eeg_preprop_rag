# How to use Django with Gunicorn

Gunicorn (‘Green Unicorn’) is a pure-Python WSGI server for UNIX. It has no
dependencies and can be installed using `pip`.

## Installing Gunicorn

Install gunicorn by running `python -m pip install gunicorn`. For more
details, see the gunicorn documentation.

## Running Django in Gunicorn as a generic WSGI application

When Gunicorn is installed, a `gunicorn` command is available which starts the
Gunicorn server process. The simplest invocation of gunicorn is to pass the
location of a module containing a WSGI application object named `application`,
which for a typical Django project would look like:

    
    gunicorn myproject.wsgi
    
This will start one process running one thread listening on `127.0.0.1:8000`.
It requires that your project be on the Python path; the simplest way to
ensure that is to run this command from the same directory as your `manage.py`
file.

See Gunicorn’s deployment documentation for additional tips.
