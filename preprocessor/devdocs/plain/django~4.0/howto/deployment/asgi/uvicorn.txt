# How to use Django with Uvicorn

Uvicorn is an ASGI server based on `uvloop` and `httptools`, with an emphasis
on speed.

## Installing Uvicorn

You can install Uvicorn with `pip`:

    
    python -m pip install uvicorn gunicorn
    
## Running Django in Uvicorn

When Uvicorn is installed, a `uvicorn` command is available which runs ASGI
applications. Uvicorn needs to be called with the location of a module
containing an ASGI application object, followed by what the application is
called (separated by a colon).

For a typical Django project, invoking Uvicorn would look like:

    
    gunicorn myproject.asgi:application -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker
    
This will start one process listening on `127.0.0.1:8000`. It requires that
your project be on the Python path; to ensure that run this command from the
same directory as your `manage.py` file.

For more advanced usage, please read the Uvicorn documentation.
