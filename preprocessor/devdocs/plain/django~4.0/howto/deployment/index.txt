# How to deploy Django

Django is full of shortcuts to make web developers’ lives easier, but all
those tools are of no use if you can’t easily deploy your sites. Since
Django’s inception, ease of deployment has been a major goal.

There are many options for deploying your Django application, based on your
architecture or your particular business needs, but that discussion is outside
the scope of what Django can give you as guidance.

Django, being a web framework, needs a web server in order to operate. And
since most web servers don’t natively speak Python, we need an interface to
make that communication happen.

Django currently supports two interfaces: WSGI and ASGI.

  * WSGI is the main Python standard for communicating between web servers and applications, but it only supports synchronous code.
  * ASGI is the new, asynchronous-friendly standard that will allow your Django site to use asynchronous Python features, and asynchronous Django features as they are developed.

You should also consider how you will handle static files for your
application, and how to handle error reporting.

Finally, before you deploy your application to production, you should run
through our deployment checklist to ensure that your configurations are
suitable.
