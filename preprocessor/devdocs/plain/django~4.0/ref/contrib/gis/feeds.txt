# Geographic Feeds

GeoDjango has its own `Feed` subclass that may embed location information in
RSS/Atom feeds formatted according to either the Simple GeoRSS or W3C Geo
standards. Because GeoDjango’s syndication API is a superset of Django’s,
please consult Django’s syndication documentation for details on general
usage.

## Example

## API Reference

###  `Feed` Subclass

`class Feed`

    
In addition to methods provided by the `django.contrib.syndication.views.Feed`
base class, GeoDjango’s `Feed` class provides the following overrides. Note
that these overrides may be done in multiple ways:

    
    from django.contrib.gis.feeds import Feed
    
    class MyFeed(Feed):
    
        # First, as a class attribute.
        geometry = ...
        item_geometry = ...
    
        # Also a function with no arguments
        def geometry(self):
            ...
    
        def item_geometry(self):
            ...
    
        # And as a function with a single argument
        def geometry(self, obj):
            ...
    
        def item_geometry(self, item):
            ...
    
`geometry(obj)`

Takes the object returned by `get_object()` and returns the feed’s geometry.
Typically this is a `GEOSGeometry` instance, or can be a tuple to represent a
point or a box. For example:

    
    class ZipcodeFeed(Feed):
    
        def geometry(self, obj):
            # Can also return: `obj.poly`, and `obj.poly.centroid`.
            return obj.poly.extent # tuple like: (X0, Y0, X1, Y1).
    
`item_geometry(item)`

Set this to return the geometry for each item in the feed. This can be a
`GEOSGeometry` instance, or a tuple that represents a point coordinate or
bounding box. For example:

    
    class ZipcodeFeed(Feed):
    
        def item_geometry(self, obj):
            # Returns the polygon.
            return obj.poly
    
###  `SyndicationFeed` Subclasses

The following `django.utils.feedgenerator.SyndicationFeed` subclasses are
available:

`class GeoRSSFeed`

`class GeoAtom1Feed`

`class W3CGeoFeed`

Note

W3C Geo formatted feeds only support `PointField` geometries.
