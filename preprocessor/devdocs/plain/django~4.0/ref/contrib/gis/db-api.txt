# GeoDjango Database API

## Spatial Backends

GeoDjango currently provides the following spatial database backends:

  * `django.contrib.gis.db.backends.postgis`
  * `django.contrib.gis.db.backends.mysql`
  * `django.contrib.gis.db.backends.oracle`
  * `django.contrib.gis.db.backends.spatialite`

### MySQL Spatial Limitations

Before MySQL 5.6.1, spatial extensions only support bounding box operations
(what MySQL calls minimum bounding rectangles, or MBR). Specifically, MySQL
did not conform to the OGC standard. Django supports spatial functions
operating on real geometries available in modern MySQL versions. However, the
spatial functions are not as rich as other backends like PostGIS.

### Raster Support

`RasterField` is currently only implemented for the PostGIS backend. Spatial
lookups are available for raster fields, but spatial database functions and
aggregates aren’t implemented for raster fields.

## Creating and Saving Models with Geometry Fields

Here is an example of how to create a geometry object (assuming the `Zipcode`
model):

    
    >>> from zipcode.models import Zipcode
    >>> z = Zipcode(code=77096, poly='POLYGON(( 10 10, 10 20, 20 20, 20 15, 10 10))')
    >>> z.save()
    
`GEOSGeometry` objects may also be used to save geometric models:

    
    >>> from django.contrib.gis.geos import GEOSGeometry
    >>> poly = GEOSGeometry('POLYGON(( 10 10, 10 20, 20 20, 20 15, 10 10))')
    >>> z = Zipcode(code=77096, poly=poly)
    >>> z.save()
    
Moreover, if the `GEOSGeometry` is in a different coordinate system (has a
different SRID value) than that of the field, then it will be implicitly
transformed into the SRID of the model’s field, using the spatial database’s
transform procedure:

    
    >>> poly_3084 = GEOSGeometry('POLYGON(( 10 10, 10 20, 20 20, 20 15, 10 10))', srid=3084)  # SRID 3084 is 'NAD83(HARN) / Texas Centric Lambert Conformal'
    >>> z = Zipcode(code=78212, poly=poly_3084)
    >>> z.save()
    >>> from django.db import connection
    >>> print(connection.queries[-1]['sql']) # printing the last SQL statement executed (requires DEBUG=True)
    INSERT INTO "geoapp_zipcode" ("code", "poly") VALUES (78212, ST_Transform(ST_GeomFromWKB('\\001 ... ', 3084), 4326))
    
Thus, geometry parameters may be passed in using the `GEOSGeometry` object,
WKT (Well Known Text [1]), HEXEWKB (PostGIS specific – a WKB geometry in
hexadecimal [2]), and GeoJSON (see RFC 7946). Essentially, if the input is not
a `GEOSGeometry` object, the geometry field will attempt to create a
`GEOSGeometry` instance from the input.

For more information creating `GEOSGeometry` objects, refer to the GEOS
tutorial.

## Creating and Saving Models with Raster Fields

When creating raster models, the raster field will implicitly convert the
input into a `GDALRaster` using lazy-evaluation. The raster field will
therefore accept any input that is accepted by the `GDALRaster` constructor.

Here is an example of how to create a raster object from a raster file
`volcano.tif` (assuming the `Elevation` model):

    
    >>> from elevation.models import Elevation
    >>> dem = Elevation(name='Volcano', rast='/path/to/raster/volcano.tif')
    >>> dem.save()
    
`GDALRaster` objects may also be used to save raster models:

    
    >>> from django.contrib.gis.gdal import GDALRaster
    >>> rast = GDALRaster({'width': 10, 'height': 10, 'name': 'Canyon', 'srid': 4326,
    ...                    'scale': [0.1, -0.1], 'bands': [{"data": range(100)}]})
    >>> dem = Elevation(name='Canyon', rast=rast)
    >>> dem.save()
    
Note that this equivalent to:

    
    >>> dem = Elevation.objects.create(
    ...     name='Canyon',
    ...     rast={'width': 10, 'height': 10, 'name': 'Canyon', 'srid': 4326,
    ...           'scale': [0.1, -0.1], 'bands': [{"data": range(100)}]},
    ... )
    
## Spatial Lookups

GeoDjango’s lookup types may be used with any manager method like `filter()`,
`exclude()`, etc. However, the lookup types unique to GeoDjango are only
available on spatial fields.

Filters on ‘normal’ fields (e.g. `CharField`) may be chained with those on
geographic fields. Geographic lookups accept geometry and raster input on both
sides and input types can be mixed freely.

The general structure of geographic lookups is described below. A complete
reference can be found in the spatial lookup reference.

### Geometry Lookups

Geographic queries with geometries take the following general form (assuming
the `Zipcode` model used in the GeoDjango Model API):

    
    >>> qs = Zipcode.objects.filter(<field>__<lookup_type>=<parameter>)
    >>> qs = Zipcode.objects.exclude(...)
    
For example:

    
    >>> qs = Zipcode.objects.filter(poly__contains=pnt)
    >>> qs = Elevation.objects.filter(poly__contains=rst)
    
In this case, `poly` is the geographic field, `contains` is the spatial lookup
type, `pnt` is the parameter (which may be a `GEOSGeometry` object or a string
of GeoJSON , WKT, or HEXEWKB), and `rst` is a `GDALRaster` object.

### Raster Lookups

The raster lookup syntax is similar to the syntax for geometries. The only
difference is that a band index can be specified as additional input. If no
band index is specified, the first band is used by default (index `0`). In
that case the syntax is identical to the syntax for geometry lookups.

To specify the band index, an additional parameter can be specified on both
sides of the lookup. On the left hand side, the double underscore syntax is
used to pass a band index. On the right hand side, a tuple of the raster and
band index can be specified.

This results in the following general form for lookups involving rasters
(assuming the `Elevation` model used in the GeoDjango Model API):

    
    >>> qs = Elevation.objects.filter(<field>__<lookup_type>=<parameter>)
    >>> qs = Elevation.objects.filter(<field>__<band_index>__<lookup_type>=<parameter>)
    >>> qs = Elevation.objects.filter(<field>__<lookup_type>=(<raster_input, <band_index>)
    
For example:

    
    >>> qs = Elevation.objects.filter(rast__contains=geom)
    >>> qs = Elevation.objects.filter(rast__contains=rst)
    >>> qs = Elevation.objects.filter(rast__1__contains=geom)
    >>> qs = Elevation.objects.filter(rast__contains=(rst, 1))
    >>> qs = Elevation.objects.filter(rast__1__contains=(rst, 1))
    
On the left hand side of the example, `rast` is the geographic raster field
and `contains` is the spatial lookup type. On the right hand side, `geom` is a
geometry input and `rst` is a `GDALRaster` object. The band index defaults to
`0` in the first two queries and is set to `1` on the others.

While all spatial lookups can be used with raster objects on both sides, not
all underlying operators natively accept raster input. For cases where the
operator expects geometry input, the raster is automatically converted to a
geometry. It’s important to keep this in mind when interpreting the lookup
results.

The type of raster support is listed for all lookups in the compatibility
table. Lookups involving rasters are currently only available for the PostGIS
backend.

## Distance Queries

### Introduction

Distance calculations with spatial data is tricky because, unfortunately, the
Earth is not flat. Some distance queries with fields in a geographic
coordinate system may have to be expressed differently because of limitations
in PostGIS. Please see the Selecting an SRID section in the GeoDjango Model
API documentation for more details.

### Distance Lookups

Availability: PostGIS, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, SpatiaLite, PGRaster (Native)

The following distance lookups are available:

  * `distance_lt`
  * `distance_lte`
  * `distance_gt`
  * `distance_gte`
  * `dwithin` (except MariaDB and MySQL)

Note

For measuring, rather than querying on distances, use the `Distance` function.

Distance lookups take a tuple parameter comprising:

  1. A geometry or raster to base calculations from; and
  2. A number or `Distance` object containing the distance.

If a `Distance` object is used, it may be expressed in any units (the SQL
generated will use units converted to those of the field); otherwise, numeric
parameters are assumed to be in the units of the field.

Note

In PostGIS, `ST_Distance_Sphere` does not limit the geometry types geographic
distance queries are performed with. [3] However, these queries may take a
long time, as great-circle distances must be calculated on the fly for every
row in the query. This is because the spatial index on traditional geometry
fields cannot be used.

For much better performance on WGS84 distance queries, consider using
geography columns in your database instead because they are able to use their
spatial index in distance queries. You can tell GeoDjango to use a geography
column by setting `geography=True` in your field definition.

For example, let’s say we have a `SouthTexasCity` model (from the GeoDjango
distance tests ) on a projected coordinate system valid for cities in southern
Texas:

    
    from django.contrib.gis.db import models
    
    class SouthTexasCity(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
        # A projected coordinate system (only valid for South Texas!)
        # is used, units are in meters.
        point = models.PointField(srid=32140)
    
Then distance queries may be performed as follows:

    
    >>> from django.contrib.gis.geos import GEOSGeometry
    >>> from django.contrib.gis.measure import D # ``D`` is a shortcut for ``Distance``
    >>> from geoapp.models import SouthTexasCity
    # Distances will be calculated from this point, which does not have to be projected.
    >>> pnt = GEOSGeometry('POINT(-96.876369 29.905320)', srid=4326)
    # If numeric parameter, units of field (meters in this case) are assumed.
    >>> qs = SouthTexasCity.objects.filter(point__distance_lte=(pnt, 7000))
    # Find all Cities within 7 km, > 20 miles away, and > 100 chains away (an obscure unit)
    >>> qs = SouthTexasCity.objects.filter(point__distance_lte=(pnt, D(km=7)))
    >>> qs = SouthTexasCity.objects.filter(point__distance_gte=(pnt, D(mi=20)))
    >>> qs = SouthTexasCity.objects.filter(point__distance_gte=(pnt, D(chain=100)))
    
Raster queries work the same way by replacing the geometry field `point` with
a raster field, or the `pnt` object with a raster object, or both. To specify
the band index of a raster input on the right hand side, a 3-tuple can be
passed to the lookup as follows:

    
    >>> qs = SouthTexasCity.objects.filter(point__distance_gte=(rst, 2, D(km=7)))
    
Where the band with index 2 (the third band) of the raster `rst` would be used
for the lookup.
