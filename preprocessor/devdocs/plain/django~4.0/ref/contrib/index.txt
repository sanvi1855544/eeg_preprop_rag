# contrib packages

Django aims to follow Python’s “batteries included” philosophy. It ships with
a variety of extra, optional tools that solve common web development problems.

This code lives in `django/contrib` in the Django distribution. This document
gives a rundown of the packages in `contrib`, along with any dependencies
those packages have.

Note

For most of these add-ons – specifically, the add-ons that include either
models or template tags – you’ll need to add the package name (e.g.,
`'django.contrib.redirects'`) to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting and re-run
`manage.py migrate`.

  * The Django admin site
  * `django.contrib.auth`
  * The contenttypes framework
  * The flatpages app
  * GeoDjango
  * `django.contrib.humanize`
  * The messages framework
  * `django.contrib.postgres`
  * The redirects app
  * The sitemap framework
  * The “sites” framework
  * The `staticfiles` app
  * The syndication feed framework

## `admin`

The automatic Django administrative interface. For more information, see
Tutorial 2 and the admin documentation.

Requires the auth and contenttypes contrib packages to be installed.

## `auth`

Django’s authentication framework.

## `contenttypes`

A light framework for hooking into “types” of content, where each installed
Django model is a separate content type.

See the contenttypes documentation.

## `flatpages`

A framework for managing “flat” HTML content in a database.

See the flatpages documentation.

Requires the sites contrib package to be installed as well.

## `gis`

A world-class geospatial framework built on top of Django, that enables
storage, manipulation and display of spatial data.

See the GeoDjango documentation for more.

## `humanize`

A set of Django template filters useful for adding a “human touch” to data.

## `sessions`

to one or more sites.

See the sitemaps documentation.

## `syndication`

A framework for generating syndication feeds, in RSS and Atom, quite easily.
