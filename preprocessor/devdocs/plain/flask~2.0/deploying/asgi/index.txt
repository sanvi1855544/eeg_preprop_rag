# ASGI

If you’d like to use an ASGI server you will need to utilise WSGI to ASGI
middleware. The asgiref [WsgiToAsgi](https://github.com/django/asgiref#wsgi-
to-asgi-adapter) adapter is recommended as it integrates with the event loop
used for Flask’s Using async and await support. You can use the adapter by
wrapping the Flask app,

    
    from asgiref.wsgi import WsgiToAsgi
    from flask import Flask
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    ...
    
    asgi_app = WsgiToAsgi(app)
    
and then serving the `asgi_app` with the asgi server, e.g. using Hypercorn,

    
    $ hypercorn module:asgi_app
