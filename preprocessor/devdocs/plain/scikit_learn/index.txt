Classification

    
Identifying which category an object belongs to.

Applications: Spam detection, image recognition. Algorithms: SVM, nearest
neighbors, random forest, and more...

Regression

    
Predicting a continuous-valued attribute associated with an object.

Applications: Drug response, Stock prices. Algorithms: SVR, nearest neighbors,
random forest, and more...

Clustering

    
Automatic grouping of similar objects into sets.

Applications: Customer segmentation, Grouping experiment outcomes Algorithms:
k-Means, spectral clustering, mean-shift, and more...

Dimensionality reduction

    
Reducing the number of random variables to consider.
