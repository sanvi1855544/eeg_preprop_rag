# sklearn.metrics.pairwise.additive_chi2_kernel

`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.additive_chi2_kernel(X, Y=None)` [source]

    
Computes the additive chi-squared kernel between observations in X and Y.

The chi-squared kernel is computed between each pair of rows in X and Y. X and
Y have to be non-negative. This kernel is most commonly applied to histograms.

The chi-squared kernel is given by:

    
    k(x, y) = -Sum [(x - y)^2 / (x + y)]
    
It can be interpreted as a weighted difference per entry.

Parameters

    
`Xarray-like of shape (n_samples_X, n_features)`

`Yndarray of shape (n_samples_Y, n_features), default=None`

Returns

    
`kernel_matrixndarray of shape (n_samples_X, n_samples_Y)`

See also

`chi2_kernel`

    
The exponentiated version of the kernel, which is usually preferable.

`sklearn.kernel_approximation.AdditiveChi2Sampler`

    
A Fourier approximation to this kernel.

#### Notes

As the negative of a distance, this kernel is only conditionally positive
definite.
