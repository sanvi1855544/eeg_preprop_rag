# sklearn.model_selection.LeavePGroupsOut

`class sklearn.model_selection.LeavePGroupsOut(n_groups)` [source]

    
Leave P Group(s) Out cross-validator

Provides train/test indices to split data according to a third-party provided
group. This group information can be used to encode arbitrary domain specific
stratifications of the samples as integers.

For instance the groups could be the year of collection of the samples and
thus allow for cross-validation against time-based splits.

The difference between LeavePGroupsOut and LeaveOneGroupOut is that the former
builds the test sets with all the samples assigned to `p` different values of
the groups while the latter uses samples all assigned the same groups.

Read more in the User Guide.

Parameters

    
`n_groupsint`

    
Number of groups (`p`) to leave out in the test split.

`GroupKFold`

    
K-fold iterator variant with non-overlapping groups.

#### Examples

    
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import LeavePGroupsOut
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
    >>> y = np.array([1, 2, 1])
    >>> groups = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> lpgo = LeavePGroupsOut(n_groups=2)
    >>> lpgo.get_n_splits(X, y, groups)
    3
    >>> lpgo.get_n_splits(groups=groups)  # 'groups' is always required
    3
    >>> print(lpgo)
    LeavePGroupsOut(n_groups=2)
    >>> for train_index, test_index in lpgo.split(X, y, groups):
    ...     print("TRAIN:", train_index, "TEST:", test_index)
    ...     X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
    ...     y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]
    ...     print(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)
    TRAIN: [2] TEST: [0 1]
    [[5 6]] [[1 2]
     [3 4]] [1] [1 2]
    TRAIN: [1] TEST: [0 2]
    [[3 4]] [[1 2]
     [5 6]] [2] [1 1]
    TRAIN: [0] TEST: [1 2]
    [[1 2]] [[3 4]
     [5 6]] [1] [2 1]
    
#### Methods

`get_n_splits`([X, y, groups]) | Returns the number of splitting iterations in the cross-validator  
---|---  
`split`(X[, y, groups]) | Generate indices to split data into training and test set.  
`get_n_splits(X=None, y=None, groups=None)` [source]

    
Returns the number of splitting iterations in the cross-validator

Parameters

    
`Xobject`

    
Always ignored, exists for compatibility.

`yobject`

    
Always ignored, exists for compatibility.

`groupsarray-like of shape (n_samples,)`

    
Group labels for the samples used while splitting the dataset into train/test
set. This ‘groups’ parameter must always be specified to calculate the number
of splits, though the other parameters can be omitted.

Returns

    
`n_splitsint`

    
Returns the number of splitting iterations in the cross-validator.

`split(X, y=None, groups=None)` [source]

    
Generate indices to split data into training and test set.

Parameters

    
`Xarray-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)`

    
Training data, where n_samples is the number of samples and n_features is the
number of features.

`yarray-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None`

    
The target variable for supervised learning problems.

`groupsarray-like of shape (n_samples,)`

    
Group labels for the samples used while splitting the dataset into train/test
set.

Yields

    
`trainndarray`

    
The training set indices for that split.

`testndarray`

    
The testing set indices for that split.
