# sklearn.feature_selection.SelectorMixin

`class sklearn.feature_selection.SelectorMixin` [source]

    
Transformer mixin that performs feature selection given a support mask

This mixin provides a feature selector implementation with `transform` and
`inverse_transform` functionality given an implementation of
`_get_support_mask`.

#### Methods

`fit_transform`(X[, y]) | Fit to data, then transform it.  
---|---  
`get_support`([indices]) | Get a mask, or integer index, of the features selected  
`inverse_transform`(X) | Reverse the transformation operation  
`transform`(X) | Reduce X to the selected features.  
`fit_transform(X, y=None, **fit_params)` [source]

    
Fit to data, then transform it.

Fits transformer to `X` and `y` with optional parameters `fit_params` and
returns a transformed version of `X`.

Parameters

    
`Xarray-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)`

    
Input samples.

`yarray-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs), default=None`

    
Target values (None for unsupervised transformations).

`**fit_paramsdict`

    
Additional fit parameters.

Returns

    
`X_newndarray array of shape (n_samples, n_features_new)`

    
Transformed array.

`get_support(indices=False)` [source]

    
Get a mask, or integer index, of the features selected

Parameters

    
`indicesbool, default=False`

    
If True, the return value will be an array of integers, rather than a boolean
mask.

Returns

    
`supportarray`

    
An index that selects the retained features from a feature vector. If
`indices` is False, this is a boolean array of shape [# input features], in
which an element is True iff its corresponding feature is selected for
retention. If `indices` is True, this is an integer array of shape [# output
features] whose values are indices into the input feature vector.

`inverse_transform(X)` [source]

    
Reverse the transformation operation

Parameters

    
`Xarray of shape [n_samples, n_selected_features]`

    
The input samples.

Returns

    
`X_rarray of shape [n_samples, n_original_features]`

    
`X` with columns of zeros inserted where features would have been removed by
`transform`.

`transform(X)` [source]

    
Reduce X to the selected features.

Parameters

    
`Xarray of shape [n_samples, n_features]`

    
The input samples.

Returns

    
`X_rarray of shape [n_samples, n_selected_features]`

    
The input samples with only the selected features.
