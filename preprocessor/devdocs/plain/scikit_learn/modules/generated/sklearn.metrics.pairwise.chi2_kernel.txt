# sklearn.metrics.pairwise.chi2_kernel

`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.chi2_kernel(X, Y=None, gamma=1.0)` [source]

    
Computes the exponential chi-squared kernel X and Y.

The chi-squared kernel is computed between each pair of rows in X and Y. X and
Y have to be non-negative. This kernel is most commonly applied to histograms.

The chi-squared kernel is given by:

    
    k(x, y) = exp(-gamma Sum [(x - y)^2 / (x + y)])
    
It can be interpreted as a weighted difference per entry.

Parameters

    
`Xarray-like of shape (n_samples_X, n_features)`

`Yndarray of shape (n_samples_Y, n_features), default=None`

`gammafloat, default=1.`

    
Scaling parameter of the chi2 kernel.

Returns

    
`kernel_matrixndarray of shape (n_samples_X, n_samples_Y)`
