# sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances_argmin_min

`sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances_argmin_min(X, Y, *, axis=1,
metric='euclidean', metric_kwargs=None)` [source]

    
Compute minimum distances between one point and a set of points.

This function computes for each row in X, the index of the row of Y which is
closest (according to the specified distance). The minimal distances are also
returned.

This is mostly equivalent to calling:

(pairwise_distances(X, Y=Y, metric=metric).argmin(axis=axis),

    
pairwise_distances(X, Y=Y, metric=metric).min(axis=axis))

but uses much less memory, and is faster for large arrays.

Parameters

    
`X{array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples_X, n_features)`

    
Array containing points.

`Y{array-like, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples_Y, n_features)`

    
Array containing points.

`axisint, default=1`

    
Axis along which the argmin and distances are to be computed.

`metricstr or callable, default=’euclidean’`

    
Metric to use for distance computation. Any metric from scikit-learn or
scipy.spatial.distance can be used.

If metric is a callable function, it is called on each pair of instances
(rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable should take two arrays
as input and return one value indicating the distance between them. This works
for Scipy’s metrics, but is less efficient than passing the metric name as a
string.

Distance matrices are not supported.

Valid values for metric are:

  * from scikit-learn: [‘cityblock’, ‘cosine’, ‘euclidean’, ‘l1’, ‘l2’, ‘manhattan’]
  * from scipy.spatial.distance: [‘braycurtis’, ‘canberra’, ‘chebyshev’, ‘correlation’, ‘dice’, ‘hamming’, ‘jaccard’, ‘kulsinski’, ‘mahalanobis’, ‘minkowski’, ‘rogerstanimoto’, ‘russellrao’, ‘seuclidean’, ‘sokalmichener’, ‘sokalsneath’, ‘sqeuclidean’, ‘yule’]

See the documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these metrics.

`metric_kwargsdict, default=None`

    
Keyword arguments to pass to specified metric function.

Returns

    
`argminndarray`

    
Y[argmin[i], :] is the row in Y that is closest to X[i, :].

`distancesndarray`

    
distances[i] is the distance between the i-th row in X and the argmin[i]-th
row in Y.
