# sklearn.metrics.label_ranking_loss

`sklearn.metrics.label_ranking_loss(y_true, y_score, *, sample_weight=None)`
[source]

    
Compute Ranking loss measure.

Compute the average number of label pairs that are incorrectly ordered given
y_score weighted by the size of the label set and the number of labels not in
the label set.

This is similar to the error set size, but weighted by the number of relevant
and irrelevant labels. The best performance is achieved with a ranking loss of
zero.

New in version 0.17: A function label_ranking_loss

Parameters

    
`y_true{ndarray, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_labels)`

    
True binary labels in binary indicator format.

`y_scorendarray of shape (n_samples, n_labels)`

    
Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive class,
confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions (as returned by
“decision_function” on some classifiers).

`sample_weightarray-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None`

    
Sample weights.

Returns

    
`lossfloat`
