# sklearn.metrics.matthews_corrcoef

`sklearn.metrics.matthews_corrcoef(y_true, y_pred, *, sample_weight=None)`
[source]

    
Compute the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).

The Matthews correlation coefficient is used in machine learning as a measure
of the quality of binary and multiclass classifications. It takes into account
true and false positives and negatives and is generally regarded as a balanced
measure which can be used even if the classes are of very different sizes. The
MCC is in essence a correlation coefficient value between -1 and +1. A
coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 an average random
prediction and -1 an inverse prediction. The statistic is also known as the
phi coefficient. [source: Wikipedia]

Binary and multiclass labels are supported. Only in the binary case does this
relate to information about true and false positives and negatives. See
references below.
