# sklearn.metrics.rand_score

`sklearn.metrics.rand_score(labels_true, labels_pred)` [source]

    
Rand index.

The Rand Index computes a similarity measure between two clusterings by
considering all pairs of samples and counting pairs that are assigned in the
same or different clusters in the predicted and true clusterings.

The raw RI score is:

RI = (number of agreeing pairs) / (number of pairs)

Parameters

    
`labels_truearray-like of shape (n_samples,), dtype=integral`

    
Ground truth class labels to be used as a reference.

`labels_predarray-like of shape (n_samples,), dtype=integral`

    
Cluster labels to evaluate.

Returns

    
`RIfloat`

    
Similarity score between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive, 1.0 stands for perfect match.

#### Examples

Perfectly matching labelings have a score of 1 even

    
    >>> from sklearn.metrics.cluster import rand_score
    >>> rand_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0])
    1.0
    
Labelings that assign all classes members to the same clusters are complete
but may not always be pure, hence penalized:

    
    >>> rand_score([0, 0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 1, 1])
    0.83...
