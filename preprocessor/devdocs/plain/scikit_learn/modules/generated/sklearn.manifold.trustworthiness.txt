# sklearn.manifold.trustworthiness

`sklearn.manifold.trustworthiness(X, X_embedded, *, n_neighbors=5,
metric='euclidean')` [source]

    
Expresses to what extent the local structure is retained.

The trustworthiness is within [0, 1]. It is defined as

\\[T(k) = 1 - \frac{2}{nk (2n - 3k - 1)} \sum^n_{i=1} \sum_{j \in
\mathcal{N}_{i}^{k}} \max(0, (r(i, j) - k))\\]

where for each sample i, \\(\mathcal{N}_{i}^{k}\\) are its k nearest neighbors
in the output space, and every sample j is its \\(r(i, j)\\)-th nearest
neighbor in the input space. In other words, any unexpected nearest neighbors
in the output space are penalised in proportion to their rank in the input
space.

Parameters

    
`Xndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features) or (n_samples, n_samples)`

    
If the metric is ‘precomputed’ X must be a square distance matrix. Otherwise
it contains a sample per row.

`X_embeddedndarray of shape (n_samples, n_components)`

    
Embedding of the training data in low-dimensional space.

`n_neighborsint, default=5`

    
Number of neighbors k that will be considered.

`metricstr or callable, default=’euclidean’`

    
Which metric to use for computing pairwise distances between samples from the
original input space. If metric is ‘precomputed’, X must be a matrix of
pairwise distances or squared distances. Otherwise, see the documentation of
argument metric in sklearn.pairwise.pairwise_distances for a list of available
metrics.

New in version 0.20.

Returns

    
`trustworthinessfloat`

    
Trustworthiness of the low-dimensional embedding.
