# sklearn.feature_extraction.image.img_to_graph

`sklearn.feature_extraction.image.img_to_graph(img, *, mask=None,
return_as=<class 'scipy.sparse.coo.coo_matrix'>, dtype=None)` [source]

    
Graph of the pixel-to-pixel gradient connections

Edges are weighted with the gradient values.

Parameters

    
`imgndarray of shape (height, width) or (height, width, channel)`

    
2D or 3D image.

`maskndarray of shape (height, width) or (height, width, channel), dtype=bool,
default=None`

    
An optional mask of the image, to consider only part of the pixels.

`return_asnp.ndarray or a sparse matrix class, default=sparse.coo_matrix`

    
The class to use to build the returned adjacency matrix.

`dtypedtype, default=None`

    
The data of the returned sparse matrix. By default it is the dtype of img

#### Notes

For scikit-learn versions 0.14.1 and prior, return_as=np.ndarray was handled
by returning a dense np.matrix instance. Going forward, np.ndarray returns an
np.ndarray, as expected.

For compatibility, user code relying on this method should wrap its calls in
`np.asarray` to avoid type issues.
