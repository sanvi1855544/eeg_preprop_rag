# sklearn.utils._safe_indexing

`sklearn.utils._safe_indexing(X, indices, *, axis=0)` [source]

    
Return rows, items or columns of X using indices.

Warning

This utility is documented, but private. This means that backward
compatibility might be broken without any deprecation cycle.

Parameters

    
`Xarray-like, sparse-matrix, list, pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Series`

    
Data from which to sample rows, items or columns. `list` are only supported
when `axis=0`.

`indicesbool, int, str, slice, array-like`

    
  * If `axis=0`, boolean and integer array-like, integer slice, and scalar integer are supported.
  * `If axis=1:`
    
    * to select a single column, `indices` can be of `int` type for all `X` types and `str` only for dataframe. The selected subset will be 1D, unless `X` is a sparse matrix in which case it will be 2D.
    * to select multiples columns, `indices` can be one of the following: `list`, `array`, `slice`. The type used in these containers can be one of the following: `int`, ‘bool’ and `str`. However, `str` is only supported when `X` is a dataframe. The selected subset will be 2D.

`axisint, default=0`

    
The axis along which `X` will be subsampled. `axis=0` will select rows while
`axis=1` will select columns.

Returns

    
subset

    
Subset of X on axis 0 or 1.

#### Notes

CSR, CSC, and LIL sparse matrices are supported. COO sparse matrices are not
supported.
