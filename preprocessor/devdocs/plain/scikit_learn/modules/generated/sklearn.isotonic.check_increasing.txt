# sklearn.isotonic.check_increasing

`sklearn.isotonic.check_increasing(x, y)` [source]

    
Determine whether y is monotonically correlated with x.

y is found increasing or decreasing with respect to x based on a Spearman
correlation test.

Parameters

    
`xarray-like of shape (n_samples,)`

    
Training data.

`yarray-like of shape (n_samples,)`

    
Training target.

Returns

    
`increasing_boolboolean`

    
Whether the relationship is increasing or decreasing.

#### Notes

The Spearman correlation coefficient is estimated from the data, and the sign
of the resulting estimate is used as the result.

In the event that the 95% confidence interval based on Fisher transform spans
zero, a warning is raised.
