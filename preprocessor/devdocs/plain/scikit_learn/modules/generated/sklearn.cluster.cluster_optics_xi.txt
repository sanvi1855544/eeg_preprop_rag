# sklearn.cluster.cluster_optics_xi

`sklearn.cluster.cluster_optics_xi(*, reachability, predecessor, ordering,
min_samples, min_cluster_size=None, xi=0.05, predecessor_correction=True)`
[source]

    
Automatically extract clusters according to the Xi-steep method.

Parameters

    
`reachabilityndarray of shape (n_samples,)`

    
Reachability distances calculated by OPTICS (`reachability_`)

`predecessorndarray of shape (n_samples,)`

    
Predecessors calculated by OPTICS.

`orderingndarray of shape (n_samples,)`

    
OPTICS ordered point indices (`ordering_`)

`min_samplesint > 1 or float between 0 and 1`

    
The same as the min_samples given to OPTICS. Up and down steep regions can’t
have more then `min_samples` consecutive non-steep points. Expressed as an
absolute number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded to be at least
2).

`min_cluster_sizeint > 1 or float between 0 and 1, default=None`

    
Minimum number of samples in an OPTICS cluster, expressed as an absolute
number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded to be at least 2). If
`None`, the value of `min_samples` is used instead.

`xifloat between 0 and 1, default=0.05`

    
Determines the minimum steepness on the reachability plot that constitutes a
cluster boundary. For example, an upwards point in the reachability plot is
defined by the ratio from one point to its successor being at most 1-xi.

`predecessor_correctionbool, default=True`

    
Correct clusters based on the calculated predecessors.

Returns

    
`labelsndarray of shape (n_samples,)`

    
The labels assigned to samples. Points which are not included in any cluster
are labeled as -1.

`clustersndarray of shape (n_clusters, 2)`

    
The list of clusters in the form of `[start, end]` in each row, with all
indices inclusive. The clusters are ordered according to `(end, -start)`
(ascending) so that larger clusters encompassing smaller clusters come after
such nested smaller clusters. Since `labels` does not reflect the hierarchy,
usually `len(clusters) > np.unique(labels)`.
