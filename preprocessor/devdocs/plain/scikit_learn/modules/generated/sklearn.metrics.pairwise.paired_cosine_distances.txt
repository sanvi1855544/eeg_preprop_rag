Parameters

    
`Xarray-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)`

`Yarray-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)`

Returns

    
`distancesndarray of shape (n_samples,)`

#### Notes

The cosine distance is equivalent to the half the squared euclidean distance
if each sample is normalized to unit norm.
