# sklearn.covariance.shrunk_covariance

`sklearn.covariance.shrunk_covariance(emp_cov, shrinkage=0.1)` [source]

    
Calculates a covariance matrix shrunk on the diagonal

Read more in the User Guide.

Parameters

    
`emp_covarray-like of shape (n_features, n_features)`

    
Covariance matrix to be shrunk

`shrinkagefloat, default=0.1`

    
Coefficient in the convex combination used for the computation of the shrunk
estimate. Range is [0, 1].

Returns

    
`shrunk_covndarray of shape (n_features, n_features)`

    
Shrunk covariance.

#### Notes

The regularized (shrunk) covariance is given by:

(1 - shrinkage) * cov + shrinkage * mu * np.identity(n_features)

where mu = trace(cov) / n_features
