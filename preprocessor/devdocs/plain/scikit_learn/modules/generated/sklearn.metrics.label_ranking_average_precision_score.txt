# sklearn.metrics.label_ranking_average_precision_score

`sklearn.metrics.label_ranking_average_precision_score(y_true, y_score, *,
sample_weight=None)` [source]

    
Compute ranking-based average precision.

Label ranking average precision (LRAP) is the average over each ground truth
label assigned to each sample, of the ratio of true vs. total labels with
lower score.

This metric is used in multilabel ranking problem, where the goal is to give
better rank to the labels associated to each sample.

The obtained score is always strictly greater than 0 and the best value is 1.

Parameters

    
`y_true{ndarray, sparse matrix} of shape (n_samples, n_labels)`

    
True binary labels in binary indicator format.

`y_scorendarray of shape (n_samples, n_labels)`

    
Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive class,
confidence values, or non-thresholded measure of decisions (as returned by
“decision_function” on some classifiers).

`sample_weightarray-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None`

    
Sample weights.

New in version 0.20.

Returns

    
`scorefloat`

#### Examples

    
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.metrics import label_ranking_average_precision_score
    >>> y_true = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]])
    >>> y_score = np.array([[0.75, 0.5, 1], [1, 0.2, 0.1]])
    >>> label_ranking_average_precision_score(y_true, y_score)
    0.416...
