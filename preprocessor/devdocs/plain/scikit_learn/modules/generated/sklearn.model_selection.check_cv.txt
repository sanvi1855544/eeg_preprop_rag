# sklearn.model_selection.check_cv

`sklearn.model_selection.check_cv(cv=5, y=None, *, classifier=False)` [source]

    
Input checker utility for building a cross-validator

Parameters

    
`cvint, cross-validation generator or an iterable, default=None`

    
Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy. Possible inputs for cv
are: - None, to use the default 5-fold cross validation, - integer, to specify
the number of folds. - CV splitter, - An iterable yielding (train, test)
splits as arrays of indices.

For integer/None inputs, if classifier is True and `y` is either binary or
multiclass, `StratifiedKFold` is used. In all other cases, `KFold` is used.

Refer User Guide for the various cross-validation strategies that can be used
here.

Changed in version 0.22: `cv` default value changed from 3-fold to 5-fold.

`yarray-like, default=None`

    
The target variable for supervised learning problems.

`classifierbool, default=False`

    
Whether the task is a classification task, in which case stratified KFold will
be used.

Returns

    
`checked_cva cross-validator instance.`

    
The return value is a cross-validator which generates the train/test splits
via the `split` method.
