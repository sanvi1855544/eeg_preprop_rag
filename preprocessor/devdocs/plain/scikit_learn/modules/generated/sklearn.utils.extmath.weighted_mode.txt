# sklearn.utils.extmath.weighted_mode

`sklearn.utils.extmath.weighted_mode(a, w, *, axis=0)` [source]

    
Returns an array of the weighted modal (most common) value in a.

If there is more than one such value, only the first is returned. The bin-
count for the modal bins is also returned.

This is an extension of the algorithm in scipy.stats.mode.

Parameters

    
`aarray-like`

    
n-dimensional array of which to find mode(s).

`warray-like`

    
n-dimensional array of weights for each value.

`axisint, default=0`

    
Axis along which to operate. Default is 0, i.e. the first axis.

Returns

    
`valsndarray`

    
Array of modal values.

`scorendarray`

    
Array of weighted counts for each mode.

#### Examples

    
    >>> from sklearn.utils.extmath import weighted_mode
    >>> x = [4, 1, 4, 2, 4, 2]
    >>> weights = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    >>> weighted_mode(x, weights)
    (array([4.]), array([3.]))
    
The value 4 appears three times: with uniform weights, the result is simply
the mode of the distribution.

    
    >>> weights = [1, 3, 0.5, 1.5, 1, 2]  # deweight the 4's
    >>> weighted_mode(x, weights)
    (array([2.]), array([3.5]))
    
The value 2 has the highest score: it appears twice with weights of 1.5 and 2:
the sum of these is 3.5.
