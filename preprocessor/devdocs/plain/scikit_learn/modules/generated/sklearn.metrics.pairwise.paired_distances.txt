# sklearn.metrics.pairwise.paired_distances

`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.paired_distances(X, Y, *, metric='euclidean',
**kwds)` [source]

    
Computes the paired distances between X and Y.

Computes the distances between (X[0], Y[0]), (X[1], Y[1]), etc…

Parameters

    
`Xndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features)`

    
Array 1 for distance computation.

`Yndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features)`

    
Array 2 for distance computation.

`metricstr or callable, default=”euclidean”`

    
The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a feature
array. If metric is a string, it must be one of the options specified in
PAIRED_DISTANCES, including “euclidean”, “manhattan”, or “cosine”.
Alternatively, if metric is a callable function, it is called on each pair of
instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable should take
two arrays from X as input and return a value indicating the distance between
them.

Returns

    
`distancesndarray of shape (n_samples,)`

See also

`pairwise_distances`

    
Computes the distance between every pair of samples.

#### Examples

    
    >>> from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import paired_distances
    >>> X = [[0, 1], [1, 1]]
    >>> Y = [[0, 1], [2, 1]]
    >>> paired_distances(X, Y)
    array([0., 1.])
