# sklearn.datasets.fetch_lfw_pairs

`sklearn.datasets.fetch_lfw_pairs(*, subset='train', data_home=None,
funneled=True, resize=0.5, color=False, slice_=slice(70, 195, None), slice(78,
172, None), download_if_missing=True)` [source]

    
Load the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) pairs dataset (classification).

Download it if necessary.

In the official README.txt this task is described as the “Restricted” task. As
I am not sure as to implement the “Unrestricted” variant correctly, I left it
as unsupported for now.

The original images are 250 x 250 pixels, but the default slice and resize
arguments reduce them to 62 x 47.

Read more in the User Guide.

Parameters

    
`subset{‘train’, ‘test’, ‘10_folds’}, default=’train’`

    
Select the dataset to load: ‘train’ for the development training set, ‘test’
for the development test set, and ‘10_folds’ for the official evaluation set
that is meant to be used with a 10-folds cross validation.

`data_homestr, default=None`

    
Specify another download and cache folder for the datasets. By default all
scikit-learn data is stored in ‘~/scikit_learn_data’ subfolders.

`funneledbool, default=True`

    
Download and use the funneled variant of the dataset.

`resizefloat, default=0.5`

    
Ratio used to resize the each face picture.

`colorbool, default=False`

    
Keep the 3 RGB channels instead of averaging them to a single gray level
channel. If color is True the shape of the data has one more dimension than
the shape with color = False.

`slice_tuple of slice, default=(slice(70, 195), slice(78, 172))`

    
Provide a custom 2D slice (height, width) to extract the ‘interesting’ part of
the jpeg files and avoid use statistical correlation from the background

`download_if_missingbool, default=True`

    
If False, raise a IOError if the data is not locally available instead of
trying to download the data from the source site.

Returns

    
`dataBunch`

    
Dictionary-like object, with the following attributes.

`datandarray of shape (2200, 5828). Shape depends on subset.`

    
Each row corresponds to 2 ravel’d face images of original size 62 x 47 pixels.
Changing the `slice_`, `resize` or `subset` parameters will change the shape
of the output.

`pairsndarray of shape (2200, 2, 62, 47). Shape depends on subset`

    
Each row has 2 face images corresponding to same or different person from the
dataset containing 5749 people. Changing the `slice_`, `resize` or `subset`
parameters will change the shape of the output.

`targetnumpy array of shape (2200,). Shape depends on subset.`

    
Labels associated to each pair of images. The two label values being different
persons or the same person.

`DESCRstring`

    
Description of the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.
