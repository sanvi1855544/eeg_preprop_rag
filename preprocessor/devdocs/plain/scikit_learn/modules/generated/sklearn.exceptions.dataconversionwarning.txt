# sklearn.exceptions.DataConversionWarning

`class sklearn.exceptions.DataConversionWarning` [source]

    
Warning used to notify implicit data conversions happening in the code.

This warning occurs when some input data needs to be converted or interpreted
in a way that may not match the user’s expectations.

For example, this warning may occur when the user

    
  * passes an integer array to a function which expects float input and will convert the input
  * requests a non-copying operation, but a copy is required to meet the implementation’s data-type expectations;
  * passes an input whose shape can be interpreted ambiguously.

Changed in version 0.18: Moved from sklearn.utils.validation.
