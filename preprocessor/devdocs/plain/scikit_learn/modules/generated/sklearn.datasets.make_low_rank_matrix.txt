# sklearn.datasets.make_low_rank_matrix

`sklearn.datasets.make_low_rank_matrix(n_samples=100, n_features=100, *,
effective_rank=10, tail_strength=0.5, random_state=None)` [source]

    
Generate a mostly low rank matrix with bell-shaped singular values.

Most of the variance can be explained by a bell-shaped curve of width
effective_rank: the low rank part of the singular values profile is:

    
    (1 - tail_strength) * exp(-1.0 * (i / effective_rank) ** 2)
    
The remaining singular values’ tail is fat, decreasing as:

    
    tail_strength * exp(-0.1 * i / effective_rank).
    
The low rank part of the profile can be considered the structured signal part
of the data while the tail can be considered the noisy part of the data that
cannot be summarized by a low number of linear components (singular vectors).

This kind of singular profiles is often seen in practice, for instance:

    
  * gray level pictures of faces
  * TF-IDF vectors of text documents crawled from the web

Parameters

    
`n_samplesint, default=100`

    
The number of samples.

`n_featuresint, default=100`

    
The number of features.

`effective_rankint, default=10`

    
The approximate number of singular vectors required to explain most of the
data by linear combinations.

`tail_strengthfloat, default=0.5`

    
The relative importance of the fat noisy tail of the singular values profile.
The value should be between 0 and 1.

`random_stateint, RandomState instance or None, default=None`

    
Determines random number generation for dataset creation. Pass an int for
reproducible output across multiple function calls. See Glossary.

Returns

    
`Xndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features)`

    
The matrix.
