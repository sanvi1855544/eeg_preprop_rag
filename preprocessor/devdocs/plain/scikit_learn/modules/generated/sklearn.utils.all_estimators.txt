# sklearn.utils.all_estimators

`sklearn.utils.all_estimators(type_filter=None)` [source]

    
Get a list of all estimators from sklearn.

This function crawls the module and gets all classes that inherit from
BaseEstimator. Classes that are defined in test-modules are not included.

Parameters

    
`type_filter{“classifier”, “regressor”, “cluster”, “transformer”} or list of
such str, default=None`

    
Which kind of estimators should be returned. If None, no filter is applied and
all estimators are returned. Possible values are ‘classifier’, ‘regressor’,
‘cluster’ and ‘transformer’ to get estimators only of these specific types, or
a list of these to get the estimators that fit at least one of the types.

Returns

    
`estimatorslist of tuples`

    
List of (name, class), where `name` is the class name as string and `class` is
the actuall type of the class.
