# sklearn.metrics.ndcg_score

`sklearn.metrics.ndcg_score(y_true, y_score, *, k=None, sample_weight=None,
ignore_ties=False)` [source]

    
Compute Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain.

Sum the true scores ranked in the order induced by the predicted scores, after
applying a logarithmic discount. Then divide by the best possible score (Ideal
DCG, obtained for a perfect ranking) to obtain a score between 0 and 1.

This ranking metric yields a high value if true labels are ranked high by
`y_score`.

Parameters

    
`y_truendarray of shape (n_samples, n_labels)`

    
True targets of multilabel classification, or true scores of entities to be
ranked.

`y_scorendarray of shape (n_samples, n_labels)`

    
Target scores, can either be probability estimates, confidence values, or non-
thresholded measure of decisions (as returned by “decision_function” on some
classifiers).

`kint, default=None`

    
Only consider the highest k scores in the ranking. If None, use all outputs.

`sample_weightndarray of shape (n_samples,), default=None`

    
Sample weights. If None, all samples are given the same weight.

`ignore_tiesbool, default=False`

    
Assume that there are no ties in y_score (which is likely to be the case if
y_score is continuous) for efficiency gains.

Returns

    
`normalized_discounted_cumulative_gainfloat in [0., 1.]`

    
The averaged NDCG scores for all samples.

#### Examples

    
    >>> from sklearn.metrics import ndcg_score
    >>> # we have groud-truth relevance of some answers to a query:
    >>> true_relevance = np.asarray([[10, 0, 0, 1, 5]])
    >>> # we predict some scores (relevance) for the answers
    >>> scores = np.asarray([[.1, .2, .3, 4, 70]])
    >>> ndcg_score(true_relevance, scores)
    0.69...
    >>> scores = np.asarray([[.05, 1.1, 1., .5, .0]])
    >>> ndcg_score(true_relevance, scores)
    0.49...
    >>> # we can set k to truncate the sum; only top k answers contribute.
    >>> ndcg_score(true_relevance, scores, k=4)
    0.35...
    >>> # the normalization takes k into account so a perfect answer
    >>> # would still get 1.0
    >>> ndcg_score(true_relevance, true_relevance, k=4)
    1.0
    >>> # now we have some ties in our prediction
    >>> scores = np.asarray([[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]])
    >>> # by default ties are averaged, so here we get the average (normalized)
    >>> # true relevance of our top predictions: (10 / 10 + 5 / 10) / 2 = .75
    >>> ndcg_score(true_relevance, scores, k=1)
    0.75
    >>> # we can choose to ignore ties for faster results, but only
    >>> # if we know there aren't ties in our scores, otherwise we get
    >>> # wrong results:
    >>> ndcg_score(true_relevance,
    ...           scores, k=1, ignore_ties=True)
    0.5
