# sklearn.metrics.homogeneity_completeness_v_measure

`sklearn.metrics.homogeneity_completeness_v_measure(labels_true, labels_pred,
*, beta=1.0)` [source]

    
Compute the homogeneity and completeness and V-Measure scores at once.

Those metrics are based on normalized conditional entropy measures of the
clustering labeling to evaluate given the knowledge of a Ground Truth class
labels of the same samples.

A clustering result satisfies homogeneity if all of its clusters contain only
data points which are members of a single class.

A clustering result satisfies completeness if all the data points that are
members of a given class are elements of the same cluster.

Both scores have positive values between 0.0 and 1.0, larger values being
desirable.

Those 3 metrics are independent of the absolute values of the labels: a
permutation of the class or cluster label values won’t change the score values
in any way.

V-Measure is furthermore symmetric: swapping `labels_true` and `label_pred`
will give the same score. This does not hold for homogeneity and completeness.
V-Measure is identical to `normalized_mutual_info_score` with the arithmetic
averaging method.

Parameters

    
`labels_trueint array, shape = [n_samples]`

    
ground truth class labels to be used as a reference

`labels_predarray-like of shape (n_samples,)`

    
cluster labels to evaluate

`betafloat, default=1.0`

    
Ratio of weight attributed to `homogeneity` vs `completeness`. If `beta` is
greater than 1, `completeness` is weighted more strongly in the calculation.
If `beta` is less than 1, `homogeneity` is weighted more strongly.

Returns

    
`homogeneityfloat`

    
score between 0.0 and 1.0. 1.0 stands for perfectly homogeneous labeling

`completenessfloat`

    
score between 0.0 and 1.0. 1.0 stands for perfectly complete labeling

`v_measurefloat`

    
harmonic mean of the first two
