# sklearn.tree.ExtraTreeClassifier

`class sklearn.tree.ExtraTreeClassifier(*, criterion='gini',
splitter='random', max_depth=None, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1,
min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, max_features='auto', random_state=None,
max_leaf_nodes=None, min_impurity_decrease=0.0, min_impurity_split=None,
class_weight=None, ccp_alpha=0.0)` [source]

    
An extremely randomized tree classifier.

Extra-trees differ from classic decision trees in the way they are built. When
looking for the best split to separate the samples of a node into two groups,
random splits are drawn for each of the `max_features` randomly selected
features and the best split among those is chosen. When `max_features` is set
1, this amounts to building a totally random decision tree.

Warning: Extra-trees should only be used within ensemble methods.

Parameters

    
`criterion{“gini”, “entropy”}, default=”gini”`

    
The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are “gini”
for the Gini impurity and “entropy” for the information gain.

`splitter{“random”, “best”}, default=”random”`

    
The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported strategies are
“best” to choose the best split and “random” to choose the best random split.

`max_depthint, default=None`

    
The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all
leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split
samples.

`min_samples_splitint or float, default=2`

    
The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

  * If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
  * If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum number of samples for each split.

Changed in version 0.18: Added float values for fractions.

`min_samples_leafint or float, default=1`

    
The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A split point at
any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least `min_samples_leaf`
training samples in each of the left and right branches. This may have the
effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.

  * If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
  * If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum number of samples for each node.

Changed in version 0.18: Added float values for fractions.

`min_weight_fraction_leaffloat, default=0.0`

    
The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all the input
samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have equal weight when
sample_weight is not provided.

`max_featuresint, float, {“auto”, “sqrt”, “log2”} or None, default=”auto”`

    
The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

  * If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
  * If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each split.
  * If “auto”, then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
  * If “sqrt”, then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
  * If “log2”, then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
  * If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one valid partition
of the node samples is found, even if it requires to effectively inspect more
than `max_features` features.

`random_stateint, RandomState instance or None, default=None`

    
Used to pick randomly the `max_features` used at each split. See Glossary for
details.

`max_leaf_nodesint, default=None`

    
Grow a tree with `max_leaf_nodes` in best-first fashion. Best nodes are
defined as relative reduction in impurity. If None then unlimited number of
leaf nodes.

`min_impurity_decreasefloat, default=0.0`

    
A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater
than or equal to this value.

The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following:

    
    N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                        - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)
    
where `N` is the total number of samples, `N_t` is the number of samples at
the current node, `N_t_L` is the number of samples in the left child, and
`N_t_R` is the number of samples in the right child.

`N`, `N_t`, `N_t_R` and `N_t_L` all refer to the weighted sum, if
`sample_weight` is passed.

New in version 0.19.

`min_impurity_splitfloat, default=None`

    
Threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split if its impurity
is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf.

Deprecated since version 0.19: `min_impurity_split` has been deprecated in
favor of `min_impurity_decrease` in 0.19. The default value of
`min_impurity_split` has changed from 1e-7 to 0 in 0.23 and it will be removed
in 1.0 (renaming of 0.25). Use `min_impurity_decrease` instead.

`class_weightdict, list of dict or “balanced”, default=None`

    
Weights associated with classes in the form `{class_label: weight}`. If None,
all classes are supposed to have weight one. For multi-output problems, a list
of dicts can be provided in the same order as the columns of y.

Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be defined for
each class of every column in its own dict. For example, for four-class
multilabel classification weights should be [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0:
1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}].

The “balanced” mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust weights
inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data as `n_samples /
(n_classes * np.bincount(y))`

For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.

Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed through
the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.

`ccp_alphanon-negative float, default=0.0`

    
Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The subtree
with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than `ccp_alpha` will be
chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See Minimal Cost-Complexity
Pruning for details.

New in version 0.22.

#### Notes

The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees (e.g.
`max_depth`, `min_samples_leaf`, etc.) lead to fully grown and unpruned trees
which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To reduce memory
consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be controlled by
setting those parameter values.
