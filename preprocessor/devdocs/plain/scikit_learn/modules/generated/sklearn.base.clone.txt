# sklearn.base.clone

`sklearn.base.clone(estimator, *, safe=True)` [source]

    
Constructs a new unfitted estimator with the same parameters.

Clone does a deep copy of the model in an estimator without actually copying
attached data. It yields a new estimator with the same parameters that has not
been fitted on any data.

If the estimator’s `random_state` parameter is an integer (or if the estimator
doesn’t have a `random_state` parameter), an exact clone is returned: the
clone and the original estimator will give the exact same results. Otherwise,
statistical clone is returned: the clone might yield different results from
the original estimator. More details can be found in Controlling randomness.

Parameters

    
`estimator{list, tuple, set} of estimator instance or a single estimator
instance`

    
The estimator or group of estimators to be cloned.

`safebool, default=True`

    
If safe is False, clone will fall back to a deep copy on objects that are not
estimators.
