# sklearn.metrics.fowlkes_mallows_score

`sklearn.metrics.fowlkes_mallows_score(labels_true, labels_pred, *,
sparse=False)` [source]

    
Measure the similarity of two clusterings of a set of points.

New in version 0.18.

The Fowlkes-Mallows index (FMI) is defined as the geometric mean between of
the precision and recall:

    
    FMI = TP / sqrt((TP + FP) * (TP + FN))
    
Where `TP` is the number of True Positive (i.e. the number of pair of points
that belongs in the same clusters in both `labels_true` and `labels_pred`),
`FP` is the number of False Positive (i.e. the number of pair of points that
belongs in the same clusters in `labels_true` and not in `labels_pred`) and
`FN` is the number of False Negative (i.e the number of pair of points that
belongs in the same clusters in `labels_pred` and not in `labels_True`).

The score ranges from 0 to 1. A high value indicates a good similarity between
two clusters.

Parameters

    
`labels_trueint array, shape = (n_samples,)`

    
A clustering of the data into disjoint subsets.

`labels_predarray, shape = (n_samples, )`

    
A clustering of the data into disjoint subsets.

`sparsebool, default=False`

    
Compute contingency matrix internally with sparse matrix.

Returns

    
`scorefloat`

    
The resulting Fowlkes-Mallows score.

#### Examples

Perfect labelings are both homogeneous and complete, hence have score 1.0:

    
    >>> from sklearn.metrics.cluster import fowlkes_mallows_score
    >>> fowlkes_mallows_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1])
    1.0
    >>> fowlkes_mallows_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0])
    1.0
    
If classes members are completely split across different clusters, the
assignment is totally random, hence the FMI is null:

    
    >>> fowlkes_mallows_score([0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3])
    0.0
