# sklearn.metrics.davies_bouldin_score

`sklearn.metrics.davies_bouldin_score(X, labels)` [source]

    
Computes the Davies-Bouldin score.

The score is defined as the average similarity measure of each cluster with
its most similar cluster, where similarity is the ratio of within-cluster
distances to between-cluster distances. Thus, clusters which are farther apart
and less dispersed will result in a better score.

The minimum score is zero, with lower values indicating better clustering.

New in version 0.20.

Parameters

    
`Xarray-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)`

    
A list of `n_features`-dimensional data points. Each row corresponds to a
single data point.

`labelsarray-like of shape (n_samples,)`

    
Predicted labels for each sample.

Returns

    
score: float

    
The resulting Davies-Bouldin score.
