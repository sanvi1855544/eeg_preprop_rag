# sklearn.utils.sparsefuncs.incr_mean_variance_axis

`sklearn.utils.sparsefuncs.incr_mean_variance_axis(X, *, axis, last_mean,
last_var, last_n, weights=None)` [source]

    
Compute incremental mean and variance along an axis on a CSR or CSC matrix.

last_mean, last_var are the statistics computed at the last step by this
function. Both must be initialized to 0-arrays of the proper size, i.e. the
number of features in X. last_n is the number of samples encountered until
now.

Parameters

    
`XCSR or CSC sparse matrix of shape (n_samples, n_features)`

    
Input data.

`axis{0, 1}`

    
Axis along which the axis should be computed.

`last_meanndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_samples,), dtype=floating`

    
Array of means to update with the new data X. Should be of shape (n_features,)
if axis=0 or (n_samples,) if axis=1.

`last_varndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_samples,), dtype=floating`

    
Array of variances to update with the new data X. Should be of shape
(n_features,) if axis=0 or (n_samples,) if axis=1.

`last_nfloat or ndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_samples,),
dtype=floating`

    
Sum of the weights seen so far, excluding the current weights If not float, it
should be of shape (n_samples,) if axis=0 or (n_features,) if axis=1. If float
it corresponds to having same weights for all samples (or features).

`weightsndarray of shape (n_samples,) or (n_features,), default=None`

    
If axis is set to 0 shape is (n_samples,) or if axis is set to 1 shape is
(n_features,). If it is set to None, then samples are equally weighted.

New in version 0.24.

Returns

    
`meansndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_samples,), dtype=floating`

    
Updated feature-wise means if axis = 0 or sample-wise means if axis = 1.

`variancesndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_samples,), dtype=floating`

    
Updated feature-wise variances if axis = 0 or sample-wise variances if axis =
1.

`nndarray of shape (n_features,) or (n_samples,), dtype=integral`

    
Updated number of seen samples per feature if axis=0 or number of seen
features per sample if axis=1.

If weights is not None, n is a sum of the weights of the seen samples or
features instead of the actual number of seen samples or features.

NaNs are ignored in the algorithm.
