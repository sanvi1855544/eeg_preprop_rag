# Data visualization

Data visualization takes an important place in image processing. Data can be a
simple unique 2D image or a more complex with multidimensional aspects: 3D in
space, timeslapse, multiple channels.

Therefore, the visualization strategy will depend on the data complexity and a
range of tools external to scikit-image can be used for this purpose.
Historically, scikit-image provided viewer tools but powerful packages are now
available and must be preferred.

## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a library able to generate static plots, which includes image
visualization.

## Plotly

Plotly is a plotting library relying on web technologies with interaction
capabilities.

## Mayavi

Mayavi can be used to visualize 3D images.

## Napari

Napari is a multi-dimensional image viewer. It’s designed for browsing,
annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images.
