#  pygame.Overlay

    
pygame object for video overlay graphics

Overlay(format, (width, height)) -> Overlay

The Overlay objects provide support for accessing hardware video overlays.
Video overlays do not use standard `RGB` pixel formats, and can use multiple
resolutions of data to create a single image.

The Overlay objects represent lower level access to the display hardware. To
use the object you must understand the technical details of video overlays.

The Overlay format determines the type of pixel data used. Not all hardware
will support all types of overlay formats. Here is a list of available format
types:

    
    YV12_OVERLAY, IYUV_OVERLAY, YUY2_OVERLAY, UYVY_OVERLAY, YVYU_OVERLAY
The width and height arguments control the size for the overlay image data.
The overlay image can be displayed at any size, not just the resolution of the
overlay.

The overlay objects are always visible, and always show above the regular
display contents.

display()

    
set the overlay pixel data

display((y, u, v)) -> None

display() -> None

Display the YUV data in SDL's overlay planes. The y, u, and v arguments are
strings of binary data. The data must be in the correct format used to create
the Overlay.

If no argument is passed in, the Overlay will simply be redrawn with the
current data. This can be useful when the Overlay is not really hardware
accelerated.

The strings are not validated, and improperly sized strings could crash the
program.

set_location()

    
control where the overlay is displayed

set_location(rect) -> None

Set the location for the overlay. The overlay will always be shown relative to
the main display Surface. This does not actually redraw the overlay, it will
be updated on the next call to `Overlay.display()`.

get_hardware()

    
test if the Overlay is hardware accelerated

get_hardware(rect) -> int

Returns a True value when the Overlay is hardware accelerated. If the platform
does not support acceleration, software rendering is used.
