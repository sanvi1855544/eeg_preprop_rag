#  pygame.locals

    
pygame constants

This module contains various constants used by pygame. Its contents are
automatically placed in the pygame module namespace. However, an application
can use `pygame.locals` to include only the pygame constants with a `from
pygame.locals import *`.

Detailed descriptions of the various constants can be found throughout the
pygame documentation. Here are the locations of some of them.

>   * The `pygame.display` module contains flags like `HWSURFACE` used by
> `pygame.display.set_mode()`.
>   * The `pygame.event` module contains the various event types.
>   * The `pygame.key` module lists the keyboard constants and modifiers
> (`K_`* and `MOD_`*) relating to the `key` and `mod` attributes of the
> `KEYDOWN` and `KEYUP` events.
>   * The `pygame.time` module defines `TIMER_RESOLUTION`.
