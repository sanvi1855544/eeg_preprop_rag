#  pygame.draw

    
pygame module for drawing shapes

Draw several simple shapes to a surface. These functions will work for
rendering to any format of surface. Rendering to hardware surfaces will be
slower than regular software surfaces.

Most of the functions take a width argument to represent the size of stroke
(thickness) around the edge of the shape. If a width of 0 is passed the shape
will be filled (solid).

All the drawing functions respect the clip area for the surface and will be
constrained to that area. The functions return a rectangle representing the
bounding area of changed pixels. This bounding rectangle is the 'minimum'
bounding box that encloses the affected area.

All the drawing functions accept a color argument that can be one of the
following formats:

>   * a `pygame.Color` object
>   * an `(RGB)` triplet (tuple/list)
>   * an `(RGBA)` quadruplet (tuple/list)
>   * an integer value that has been mapped to the surface's pixel format (see
> `pygame.Surface.map_rgb()` and `pygame.Surface.unmap_rgb()`)
>

A color's alpha value will be written directly into the surface (if the
surface contains pixel alphas), but the draw function will not draw
transparently.

These functions temporarily lock the surface they are operating on. Many
sequential drawing calls can be sped up by locking and unlocking the surface
object around the draw calls (see `pygame.Surface.lock()` and
`pygame.Surface.unlock()`).

Note

See the `pygame.gfxdraw` module for alternative draw methods.

pygame.draw.rect()

    
draw a rectangle

rect(surface, color, rect) -> Rect

rect(surface, color, rect, width=0, border_radius=0,
border_top_left_radius=-1, border_top_right_radius=-1,
border_bottom_left_radius=-1, border_bottom_right_radius=-1) -> Rect

Draws a rectangle on the given surface.

Parameters: | 
  * surface (Surface) -- surface to draw on
  * color (Color or int or tuple(int, int, int, [int])) -- color to draw with, the alpha value is optional if using a tuple `(RGB[A])`
  * rect (Rect) -- rectangle to draw, position and dimensions
  * width (int) -- (optional) used for line thickness or to indicate that the rectangle is to be filled (not to be confused with the width value of the `rect` parameter)
> if `width == 0`, (default) fill the rectangle if `width > 0`, used for line
> thickness if `width < 0`, nothing will be drawn  
>  Note When using `width` values `> 1`, the edge lines will grow outside the
> original boundary of the rect. For more details on how the thickness for
> edge lines grow, refer to the `width` notes of the `pygame.draw.line()`
> function.
  * border_radius (int) -- (optional) used for drawing rectangle with rounded corners. The supported range is [0, min(height, width) / 2], with 0 representing a rectangle without rounded corners.
  * border_top_left_radius (int) -- (optional) used for setting the value of top left border. If you don't set this value, it will use the border_radius value.
  * border_top_right_radius (int) -- (optional) used for setting the value of top right border. If you don't set this value, it will use the border_radius value.
  * border_bottom_left_radius (int) -- (optional) used for setting the value of bottom left border. If you don't set this value, it will use the border_radius value.
  * border_bottom_right_radius (int) -- (optional) used for setting the value of bottom right border. If you don't set this value, it will use the border_radius value.
> if `border_radius < 1` it will draw rectangle without rounded corners if any
> of border radii has the value `< 0` it will use value of the border_radius
> If sum of radii on the same side of the rectangle is greater than the rect
> size the radii will get scaled

  
---|---  
Returns: |  a rect bounding the changed pixels, if nothing is drawn the bounding rect's position will be the position of the given `rect` parameter and its width and height will be 0  
Return type: |  Rect  
Note

The `pygame.Surface.fill()` method works just as well for drawing filled
rectangles and can be hardware accelerated on some platforms with both
software and hardware display modes.

Changed in pygame 2.0.0: Added support for keyword arguments.

Changed in pygame 2.0.0.dev8: Added support for border radius.

Returns: |  a rect bounding the changed pixels, if nothing is drawn the bounding rect's position will be the `center` parameter value (float values will be truncated) and its width and height will be 0  
Return type: |  Rect

when the radius is 0 (a pixel at the `center` coordinates used to be drawn
when the radius equaled 0). Floats, and Vector2 are accepted for the `center`
param. The drawing algorithm was improved to look more like a circle.

pygame.draw.line()

    
draw a straight line

line(surface, color, start_pos, end_pos, width) -> Rect

line(surface, color, start_pos, end_pos, width=1) -> Rect

Draws a straight line on the given surface. There are no endcaps. For thick
lines the ends are squared off.

Parameters: | 
  * surface (Surface) -- surface to draw on
  * color (Color or int or tuple(int, int, int, [int])) -- color to draw with, the alpha value is optional if using a tuple `(RGB[A])`
  * start_pos (tuple(int or float, int or float) or list(int or float, int or float) or Vector2(int or float, int or float)) -- start position of the line, (x, y)
  * end_pos (tuple(int or float, int or float) or list(int or float, int or float) or Vector2(int or float, int or float)) -- end position of the line, (x, y)
  * width (int) -- (optional) used for line thickness if width >= 1, used for line thickness (default is 1) if width < 1, nothing will be drawn   
Note When using `width` values `> 1`, lines will grow as follows. For odd
`width` values, the thickness of each line grows with the original line being
in the center. For even `width` values, the thickness of each line grows with
the original line being offset from the center (as there is no exact center
line drawn). As a result, lines with a slope < 1 (horizontal-ish) will have 1
more pixel of thickness below the original line (in the y direction). Lines
with a slope >= 1 (vertical-ish) will have 1 more pixel of thickness to the
right of the original line (in the x direction).

  
---|---  
Returns: |  a rect bounding the changed pixels, if nothing is drawn the bounding rect's position will be the `start_pos` parameter value (float values will be truncated) and its width and height will be 0  
Return type: |  Rect  
Raises: |  TypeError \-- if `start_pos` or `end_pos` is not a sequence of two numbers  
Changed in pygame 2.0.0: Added support for keyword arguments.

pygame.draw.lines()

    
draw multiple contiguous straight line segments

lines(surface, color, closed, points) -> Rect

lines(surface, color, closed, points, width=1) -> Rect

Draws a sequence of contiguous straight lines on the given surface. There are
no endcaps or miter joints. For thick lines the ends are squared off. Drawing
thick lines with sharp corners can have undesired looking results.

Parameters: | 
  * surface (Surface) -- surface to draw on
  * color (Color or int or tuple(int, int, int, [int])) -- color to draw with, the alpha value is optional if using a tuple `(RGB[A])`
  * closed (bool) -- if `True` an additional line segment is drawn between the first and last points in the `points` sequence
  * points (tuple(coordinate) or list(coordinate)) -- a sequence of 2 or more (x, y) coordinates, where each coordinate in the sequence must be a tuple/list/`pygame.math.Vector2` of 2 ints/floats and adjacent coordinates will be connected by a line segment, e.g. for the points `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)]` a line segment will be drawn from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)` and from `(x2, y2)` to `(x3, y3)`, additionally if the `closed` parameter is `True` another line segment will be drawn from `(x3, y3)` to `(x1, y1)`
  * width (int) -- (optional) used for line thickness if width >= 1, used for line thickness (default is 1) if width < 1, nothing will be drawn   
Note When using `width` values `> 1` refer to the `width` notes of `line()`
for details on how thick lines grow.

  
---|---  
Returns: |  a rect bounding the changed pixels, if nothing is drawn the bounding rect's position will be the position of the first point in the `points` parameter (float values will be truncated) and its width and height will be 0

pygame.draw.aaline()

    
draw a straight antialiased line

aaline(surface, color, start_pos, end_pos) -> Rect

aaline(surface, color, start_pos, end_pos, blend=1) -> Rect

Draws a straight antialiased line on the given surface.

The line has a thickness of one pixel and the endpoints have a height and
width of one pixel each.

The way a line and it's endpoints are drawn:

    
If both endpoints are equal, only a single pixel is drawn (after rounding
floats to nearest integer).

Otherwise if the line is not steep (i.e. if the length along the x-axis is
greater than the height along the y-axis):

> For each endpoint:
>> If `x`, the endpoint's x-coordinate, is a whole number find which pixels
would be covered by it and draw them.

>> Otherwise:

>>> Calculate the position of the nearest point with a whole number for it's
x-coordinate, when extending the line past the endpoint.

>>> Find which pixels would be covered and how much by that point.

>>> If the endpoint is the left one, multiply the coverage by (1 - the decimal
part of `x`).

>>> Otherwise multiply the coverage by the decimal part of `x`.

>>> Then draw those pixels.

>>> e.g.:

>>>  
>>> The left endpoint of the line `((1, 1.3), (5, 3))` would cover 70% of the
pixel `(1, 1)` and 30% of the pixel `(1, 2)` while the right one would cover
100% of the pixel `(5, 3)`.

>>> The left endpoint of the line `((1.2, 1.4), (4.6, 3.1))` would cover 56%
(i.e. 0.8 * 70%) of the pixel `(1, 1)` and 24% (i.e. 0.8 * 30%) of the pixel
`(1, 2)` while the right one would cover 42% (i.e. 0.6 * 70%) of the pixel
`(5, 3)` and 18% (i.e. 0.6 * 30%) of the pixel `(5, 4)` while the right

> Then for each point between the endpoints, along the line, whose
> x-coordinate is a whole number:
>> Find which pixels would be covered and how much by that point and draw
them.

>> e.g.:

>>  
>> The points along the line `((1, 1), (4, 2.5))` would be `(2, 1.5)` and `(3,
2)` and would cover 50% of the pixel `(2, 1)`, 50% of the pixel `(2, 2)` and
100% of the pixel `(3, 2)`.

>> The points along the line `((1.2, 1.4), (4.6, 3.1))` would be `(2, 1.8)`
(covering 20% of the pixel `(2, 1)` and 80% of the pixel `(2, 2)`), `(3, 2.3)`
(covering 70% of the pixel `(3, 2)` and 30% of the pixel `(3, 3)`) and `(4,
2.8)` (covering 20% of the pixel `(2, 1)` and 80% of the pixel `(2, 2)`)

Otherwise do the same for steep lines as for non-steep lines except along the
y-axis instead of the x-axis (using `y` instead of `x`, top instead of left
and bottom instead of right).

Note

Regarding float values for coordinates, a point with coordinate consisting of
two whole numbers is considered being right in the center of said pixel (and
having a height and width of 1 pixel would therefore completely cover it),
while a point with coordinate where one (or both) of the numbers have non-zero
decimal parts would be partially covering two (or four if both numbers have
decimal parts) adjacent pixels, e.g. the point `(1.4, 2)` covers 60% of the
pixel `(1, 2)` and 40% of the pixel `(2,2)`.

Parameters: | 
  * surface (Surface) -- surface to draw on
