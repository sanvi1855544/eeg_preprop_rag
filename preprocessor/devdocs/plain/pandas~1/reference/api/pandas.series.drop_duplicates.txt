Series.drop_duplicates(keep='first', inplace=False)[source]

    
Return Series with duplicate values removed.

Parameters

    
keep:{‘first’, ‘last’, False}, default ‘first’

    
Method to handle dropping duplicates:

  * ‘first’ : Drop duplicates except for the first occurrence.
  * ‘last’ : Drop duplicates except for the last occurrence.
  * `False` : Drop all duplicates.

inplace:bool, default False

    
If `True`, performs operation inplace and returns None.

Returns

    
Series or None

    
Series with duplicates dropped or None if `inplace=True`.

Examples

Generate a Series with duplicated entries.

    
    >>> s = pd.Series(['lama', 'cow', 'lama', 'beetle', 'lama', 'hippo'],
    ...               name='animal')
    >>> s
    0      lama
    1       cow
    2      lama
    3    beetle
    4      lama
    5     hippo
    Name: animal, dtype: object
    
With the ‘keep’ parameter, the selection behaviour of duplicated values can be
changed. The value ‘first’ keeps the first occurrence for each set of
duplicated entries. The default value of keep is ‘first’.

    
    >>> s.drop_duplicates()
    0      lama
    1       cow
    3    beetle
    5     hippo
    Name: animal, dtype: object
    
The value ‘last’ for parameter ‘keep’ keeps the last occurrence for each set
of duplicated entries.

    
    >>> s.drop_duplicates(keep='last')
    1       cow
    3    beetle
    4      lama
    5     hippo
    Name: animal, dtype: object
    
The value `False` for parameter ‘keep’ discards all sets of duplicated
entries. Setting the value of ‘inplace’ to `True` performs the operation
inplace and returns `None`.

    
    >>> s.drop_duplicates(keep=False, inplace=True)
    >>> s
    1       cow
    3    beetle
    5     hippo
    Name: animal, dtype: object
