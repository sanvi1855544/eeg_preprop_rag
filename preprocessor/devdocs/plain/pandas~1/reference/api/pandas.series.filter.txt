# pandas.Series.filter

Series.filter(items=None, like=None, regex=None, axis=None)[source]

    
Subset the dataframe rows or columns according to the specified index labels.

Note that this routine does not filter a dataframe on its contents. The filter
is applied to the labels of the index.

Parameters

    
items:list-like

    
Keep labels from axis which are in items.

like:str

    
Keep labels from axis for which “like in label == True”.

regex:str (regular expression)

    
Keep labels from axis for which re.search(regex, label) == True.

axis:{0 or ‘index’, 1 or ‘columns’, None}, default None

    
The axis to filter on, expressed either as an index (int) or axis name (str).
By default this is the info axis, ‘index’ for Series, ‘columns’ for DataFrame.

Returns

    
same type as input object

See also

`DataFrame.loc`

    
Access a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array.

Notes

The `items`, `like`, and `regex` parameters are enforced to be mutually
exclusive.

`axis` defaults to the info axis that is used when indexing with `[]`.

Examples

    
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame(np.array(([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])),
    ...                   index=['mouse', 'rabbit'],
    ...                   columns=['one', 'two', 'three'])
    >>> df
            one  two  three
    mouse     1    2      3
    rabbit    4    5      6
    
    
    >>> # select columns by name
    >>> df.filter(items=['one', 'three'])
             one  three
    mouse     1      3
    rabbit    4      6
    
    
    >>> # select columns by regular expression
    >>> df.filter(regex='e$', axis=1)
             one  three
    mouse     1      3
    rabbit    4      6
    
    
    >>> # select rows containing 'bbi'
    >>> df.filter(like='bbi', axis=0)
             one  two  three
    rabbit    4    5      6
