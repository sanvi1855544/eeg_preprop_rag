# pandas.api.extensions.ExtensionDtype.kind

propertyExtensionDtype.kind

    
A character code (one of ‘biufcmMOSUV’), default ‘O’

This should match the NumPy dtype used when the array is converted to an
ndarray, which is probably ‘O’ for object if the extension type cannot be
represented as a built-in NumPy type.
