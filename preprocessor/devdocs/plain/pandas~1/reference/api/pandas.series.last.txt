# pandas.Series.last

Series.last(offset)[source]

    
Select final periods of time series data based on a date offset.

For a DataFrame with a sorted DatetimeIndex, this function selects the last
few rows based on a date offset.

Parameters

    
offset:str, DateOffset, dateutil.relativedelta

    
The offset length of the data that will be selected. For instance, ‘3D’ will
display all the rows having their index within the last 3 days.

Returns

    
Series or DataFrame

    
A subset of the caller.

Raises

    
TypeError

    
If the index is not a `DatetimeIndex`

See also

`first`

    
Select initial periods of time series based on a date offset.

`at_time`

    
Select values at a particular time of the day.

`between_time`

    
Select values between particular times of the day.

Examples

    
    >>> i = pd.date_range('2018-04-09', periods=4, freq='2D')
    >>> ts = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3, 4]}, index=i)
    >>> ts
                A
    2018-04-09  1
    2018-04-11  2
    2018-04-13  3
    2018-04-15  4
    
Get the rows for the last 3 days:

    
    >>> ts.last('3D')
                A
    2018-04-13  3
    2018-04-15  4
    
Notice the data for 3 last calendar days were returned, not the last 3
observed days in the dataset, and therefore data for 2018-04-11 was not
returned.
