# pandas.Series.str.zfill

Series.str.zfill(width)[source]

    
Pad strings in the Series/Index by prepending ‘0’ characters.

Strings in the Series/Index are padded with ‘0’ characters on the left of the
string to reach a total string length width. Strings in the Series/Index with
length greater or equal to width are unchanged.

Parameters

    
width:int

    
Minimum length of resulting string; strings with length less than width be
prepended with ‘0’ characters.

Returns

    
Series/Index of objects.

See also

`Series.str.rjust`

    
Fills the left side of strings with an arbitrary character.

`Series.str.ljust`

    
Fills the right side of strings with an arbitrary character.

`Series.str.pad`

    
Fills the specified sides of strings with an arbitrary character.

`Series.str.center`

    
Fills both sides of strings with an arbitrary character.

Notes

Differs from `str.zfill()` which has special handling for ‘+’/’-’ in the
string.

Examples

    
    >>> s = pd.Series(['-1', '1', '1000', 10, np.nan])
    >>> s
    0      -1
    1       1
    2    1000
    3      10
    4     NaN
    dtype: object
    
Note that `10` and `NaN` are not strings, therefore they are converted to
`NaN`. The minus sign in `'-1'` is treated as a regular character and the zero
is added to the left of it (`str.zfill()` would have moved it to the left).
`1000` remains unchanged as it is longer than width.

    
    >>> s.str.zfill(3)
    0     0-1
    1     001
    2    1000
    3     NaN
    4     NaN
    dtype: object
