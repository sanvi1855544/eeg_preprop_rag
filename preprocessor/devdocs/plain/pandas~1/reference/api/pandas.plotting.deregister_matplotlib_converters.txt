# pandas.plotting.deregister_matplotlib_converters

pandas.plotting.deregister_matplotlib_converters()[source]

    
Remove pandas formatters and converters.

Removes the custom converters added by `register()`. This attempts to set the
state of the registry back to the state before pandas registered its own
units. Converters for pandas’ own types like Timestamp and Period are removed
completely. Converters for types pandas overwrites, like `datetime.datetime`,
are restored to their original value.
