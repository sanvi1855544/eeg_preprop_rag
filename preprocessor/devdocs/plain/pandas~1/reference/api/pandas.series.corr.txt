# pandas.Series.corr

Series.corr(other, method='pearson', min_periods=None)[source]

    
Compute correlation with other Series, excluding missing values.

Parameters

    
other:Series

    
Series with which to compute the correlation.

method:{‘pearson’, ‘kendall’, ‘spearman’} or callable

    
Method used to compute correlation:

  * pearson : Standard correlation coefficient
  * kendall : Kendall Tau correlation coefficient
  * spearman : Spearman rank correlation
  * callable: Callable with input two 1d ndarrays and returning a float.

Warning

Note that the returned matrix from corr will have 1 along the diagonals and
will be symmetric regardless of the callable’s behavior.

min_periods:int, optional

    
Minimum number of observations needed to have a valid result.

Returns

    
float

    
Correlation with other.

Examples

    
    >>> def histogram_intersection(a, b):
    ...     v = np.minimum(a, b).sum().round(decimals=1)
    ...     return v
    >>> s1 = pd.Series([.2, .0, .6, .2])
    >>> s2 = pd.Series([.3, .6, .0, .1])
    >>> s1.corr(s2, method=histogram_intersection)
