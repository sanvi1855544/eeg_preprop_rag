# pandas.Series.cov

Series.cov(other, min_periods=None, ddof=1)[source]

    
Compute covariance with Series, excluding missing values.

Parameters

    
other:Series

    
Series with which to compute the covariance.

min_periods:int, optional

    
Minimum number of observations needed to have a valid result.

ddof:int, default 1

    
Delta degrees of freedom. The divisor used in calculations is `N - ddof`,
where `N` represents the number of elements.

New in version 1.1.0.

Returns

    
float

    
Covariance between Series and other normalized by N-1 (unbiased estimator).

Compute pairwise covariance of columns.

Examples

    
    >>> s1 = pd.Series([0.90010907, 0.13484424, 0.62036035])
    >>> s2 = pd.Series([0.12528585, 0.26962463, 0.51111198])
    >>> s1.cov(s2)
