# pandas.Series.first

Series.first(offset)[source]

    
Select initial periods of time series data based on a date offset.

When having a DataFrame with dates as index, this function can select the
first few rows based on a date offset.

Parameters

    
offset:str, DateOffset or dateutil.relativedelta

    
The offset length of the data that will be selected. For instance, ‘1M’ will
display all the rows having their index within the first month.

Returns

    
Series or DataFrame

    
A subset of the caller.

Raises

    
TypeError

    
If the index is not a `DatetimeIndex`

See also

`last`

    
Select final periods of time series based on a date offset.

`at_time`

    
Select values at a particular time of the day.

`between_time`

    
Select values between particular times of the day.

Examples

    
    >>> i = pd.date_range('2018-04-09', periods=4, freq='2D')
    >>> ts = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3, 4]}, index=i)
    >>> ts
                A
    2018-04-09  1
    2018-04-11  2
    2018-04-13  3
    2018-04-15  4
    
Get the rows for the first 3 days:

    
    >>> ts.first('3D')
                A
    2018-04-09  1
    2018-04-11  2
    
Notice the data for 3 first calendar days were returned, not the first 3 days
observed in the dataset, and therefore data for 2018-04-13 was not returned.
