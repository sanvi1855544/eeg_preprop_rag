# pandas.io.formats.style.Styler.bar

Styler.bar(subset=None, axis=0, *, color=None, cmap=None, width=100,
height=100, align='mid', vmin=None, vmax=None, props='width: 10em;')[source]

    
Draw bar chart in the cell backgrounds.

Changed in version 1.4.0.

Parameters

    
subset:label, array-like, IndexSlice, optional

    
A valid 2d input to DataFrame.loc[<subset>], or, in the case of a 1d input or
single key, to DataFrame.loc[:, <subset>] where the columns are prioritised,
to limit `data` to before applying the function.

axis:{0 or ‘index’, 1 or ‘columns’, None}, default 0

    
Apply to each column (`axis=0` or `'index'`), to each row (`axis=1` or
`'columns'`), or to the entire DataFrame at once with `axis=None`.

color:str or 2-tuple/list

    
If a str is passed, the color is the same for both negative and positive
numbers. If 2-tuple/list is used, the first element is the color_negative and
the second is the color_positive (eg: [‘#d65f5f’, ‘#5fba7d’]).

cmap:str, matplotlib.cm.ColorMap

    
A string name of a matplotlib Colormap, or a Colormap object. Cannot be used
together with `color`.

New in version 1.4.0.

width:float, default 100

    
The percentage of the cell, measured from the left, in which to draw the bars,
in [0, 100].

height:float, default 100

    
The percentage height of the bar in the cell, centrally aligned, in [0,100].

New in version 1.4.0.

align:str, int, float, callable, default ‘mid’

    
How to align the bars within the cells relative to a width adjusted center. If
string must be one of:

  * ‘left’ : bars are drawn rightwards from the minimum data value.
  * ‘right’ : bars are drawn leftwards from the maximum data value.
  * ‘zero’ : a value of zero is located at the center of the cell.
  * ‘mid’ : a value of (max-min)/2 is located at the center of the cell, or if all values are negative (positive) the zero is aligned at the right (left) of the cell.
  * ‘mean’ : the mean value of the data is located at the center of the cell.

If a float or integer is given this will indicate the center of the cell.

If a callable should take a 1d or 2d array and return a scalar.

Changed in version 1.4.0.

vmin:float, optional

    
Minimum bar value, defining the left hand limit of the bar drawing range,
lower values are clipped to vmin. When None (default): the minimum value of
the data will be used.

vmax:float, optional

    
Maximum bar value, defining the right hand limit of the bar drawing range,
higher values are clipped to vmax. When None (default): the maximum value of
the data will be used.

props:str, optional

    
The base CSS of the cell that is extended to add the bar chart. Defaults to
“width: 10em;”.

New in version 1.4.0.

Returns

    
self:Styler

Notes

This section of the user guide: Table Visualization gives a number of examples
for different settings and color coordination.
