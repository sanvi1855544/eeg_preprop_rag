# pandas.Series.combine

Series.combine(other, func, fill_value=None)[source]

    
Combine the Series with a Series or scalar according to func.

Combine the Series and other using func to perform elementwise selection for
combined Series. fill_value is assumed when value is missing at some index
from one of the two objects being combined.

Parameters

    
other:Series or scalar

    
The value(s) to be combined with the Series.

func:function

    
Function that takes two scalars as inputs and returns an element.

fill_value:scalar, optional

    
The value to assume when an index is missing from one Series or the other. The
default specifies to use the appropriate NaN value for the underlying dtype of
the Series.

Returns

    
Series

    
The result of combining the Series with the other object.

Combine Series values, choosing the calling Series’ values first.

Examples

Consider 2 Datasets `s1` and `s2` containing highest clocked speeds of
different birds.

    
    >>> s1 = pd.Series({'falcon': 330.0, 'eagle': 160.0})
    >>> s1
    falcon    330.0
    eagle     160.0
    dtype: float64
    >>> s2 = pd.Series({'falcon': 345.0, 'eagle': 200.0, 'duck': 30.0})
    >>> s2
    falcon    345.0
    eagle     200.0
    duck       30.0
    dtype: float64
    
Now, to combine the two datasets and view the highest speeds of the birds
across the two datasets

    
    >>> s1.combine(s2, max)
    duck        NaN
    eagle     200.0
    falcon    345.0
    dtype: float64
    
In the previous example, the resulting value for duck is missing, because the
maximum of a NaN and a float is a NaN. So, in the example, we set
`fill_value=0`, so the maximum value returned will be the value from some
dataset.

    
    >>> s1.combine(s2, max, fill_value=0)
    duck       30.0
    eagle     200.0
    falcon    345.0
    dtype: float64
