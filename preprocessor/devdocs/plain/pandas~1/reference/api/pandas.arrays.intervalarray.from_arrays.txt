# pandas.arrays.IntervalArray.from_arrays

classmethodIntervalArray.from_arrays(left, right, closed='right', copy=False,
dtype=None)[source]

    
Construct from two arrays defining the left and right bounds.

Parameters

    
left:array-like (1-dimensional)

    
Left bounds for each interval.

right:array-like (1-dimensional)

    
Right bounds for each interval.

closed:{‘left’, ‘right’, ‘both’, ‘neither’}, default ‘right’

    
Whether the intervals are closed on the left-side, right-side, both or
neither.

copy:bool, default False

    
Copy the data.

dtype:dtype, optional

    
If None, dtype will be inferred.

Returns

    
IntervalArray

Raises

    
ValueError

    
When a value is missing in only one of left or right. When a value in left is
greater than the corresponding value in right.

`interval_range`

    
Function to create a fixed frequency IntervalIndex.

`IntervalArray.from_breaks`

    
Construct an IntervalArray from an array of splits.

`IntervalArray.from_tuples`

    
Construct an IntervalArray from an array-like of tuples.

Notes

Each element of left must be less than or equal to the right element at the
same position. If an element is missing, it must be missing in both left and
right. A TypeError is raised when using an unsupported type for left or right.
At the moment, ‘category’, ‘object’, and ‘string’ subtypes are not supported.
