# pandas.Series.swaplevel

Series.swaplevel(i=- 2, j=- 1, copy=True)[source]

    
Swap levels i and j in a `MultiIndex`.

Default is to swap the two innermost levels of the index.

Parameters

    
i, j:int or str

    
Levels of the indices to be swapped. Can pass level name as string.

copy:bool, default True

    
Whether to copy underlying data.

Returns

    
Series

    
Series with levels swapped in MultiIndex.

Examples

    
    >>> s = pd.Series(
    ...     ["A", "B", "A", "C"],
    ...     index=[
    ...         ["Final exam", "Final exam", "Coursework", "Coursework"],
    ...         ["History", "Geography", "History", "Geography"],
    ...         ["January", "February", "March", "April"],
    ...     ],
    ... )
    >>> s
    Final exam  History     January      A
                Geography   February     B
    Coursework  History     March        A
                Geography   April        C
    dtype: object
    
In the following example, we will swap the levels of the indices. Here, we
will swap the levels column-wise, but levels can be swapped row-wise in a
similar manner. Note that column-wise is the default behaviour. By not
supplying any arguments for i and j, we swap the last and second to last
indices.

    
    >>> s.swaplevel()
    Final exam  January     History         A
                February    Geography       B
    Coursework  March       History         A
                April       Geography       C
    dtype: object
    
By supplying one argument, we can choose which index to swap the last index
with. We can for example swap the first index with the last one as follows.

    
    >>> s.swaplevel(0)
    January     History     Final exam      A
    February    Geography   Final exam      B
    March       History     Coursework      A
    April       Geography   Coursework      C
    dtype: object
    
We can also define explicitly which indices we want to swap by supplying
values for both i and j. Here, we for example swap the first and second
indices.

    
    >>> s.swaplevel(0, 1)
    History     Final exam  January         A
    Geography   Final exam  February        B
    History     Coursework  March           A
    Geography   Coursework  April           C
    dtype: object
