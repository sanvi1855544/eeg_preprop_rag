# pandas.Index.is_

finalIndex.is_(other)[source]

    
More flexible, faster check like `is` but that works through views.

Note: this is not the same as `Index.identical()`, which checks that metadata
is also the same.

Parameters

    
other:object

    
Other object to compare against.

Returns

    
bool

    
True if both have same underlying data, False otherwise.

`Index.identical`

    
Works like `Index.is_` but also checks metadata.
