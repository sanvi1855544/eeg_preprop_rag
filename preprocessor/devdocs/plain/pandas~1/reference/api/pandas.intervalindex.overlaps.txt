# pandas.IntervalIndex.overlaps

IntervalIndex.overlaps(*args, **kwargs)[source]

    
Check elementwise if an Interval overlaps the values in the IntervalArray.

Two intervals overlap if they share a common point, including closed
endpoints. Intervals that only have an open endpoint in common do not overlap.

Parameters

    
other:IntervalArray

    
Interval to check against for an overlap.

Returns

    
ndarray

    
Boolean array positionally indicating where an overlap occurs.

See also

`Interval.overlaps`

    
Check whether two Interval objects overlap.

Examples

    
    >>> data = [(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 4)]
    >>> intervals = pd.arrays.IntervalArray.from_tuples(data)
    >>> intervals
    <IntervalArray>
    [(0, 1], (1, 3], (2, 4]]
    Length: 3, dtype: interval[int64, right]
    
    
    >>> intervals.overlaps(pd.Interval(0.5, 1.5))
    array([ True,  True, False])
    
Intervals that share closed endpoints overlap:

    
    >>> intervals.overlaps(pd.Interval(1, 3, closed='left'))
    array([ True,  True, True])
    
Intervals that only have an open endpoint in common do not overlap:

    
    >>> intervals.overlaps(pd.Interval(1, 2, closed='right'))
    array([False,  True, False])
