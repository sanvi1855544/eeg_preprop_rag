# pandas.Index.asof_locs

Index.asof_locs(where, mask)[source]

    
Return the locations (indices) of labels in the index.

As in the asof function, if the label (a particular entry in where) is not in
the index, the latest index label up to the passed label is chosen and its
index returned.

If all of the labels in the index are later than a label in where, -1 is
returned.

mask is used to ignore NA values in the index during calculation.

Parameters

    
where:Index

    
An Index consisting of an array of timestamps.

mask:np.ndarray[bool]

    
Array of booleans denoting where values in the original data are not NA.

Returns

    
np.ndarray[np.intp]

    
An array of locations (indices) of the labels from the Index which correspond
to the return values of the asof function for every element in where.
