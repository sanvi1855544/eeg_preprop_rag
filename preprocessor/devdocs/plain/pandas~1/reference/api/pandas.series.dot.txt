# pandas.Series.dot

Series.dot(other)[source]

    
Compute the dot product between the Series and the columns of other.

This method computes the dot product between the Series and another one, or
the Series and each columns of a DataFrame, or the Series and each columns of
an array.

It can also be called using self @ other in Python >= 3.5.

Parameters

    
other:Series, DataFrame or array-like

    
The other object to compute the dot product with its columns.

Returns

    
scalar, Series or numpy.ndarray

    
Return the dot product of the Series and other if other is a Series, the
Series of the dot product of Series and each rows of other if other is a
DataFrame or a numpy.ndarray between the Series and each columns of the numpy
array.

See also

`DataFrame.dot`

    
Compute the matrix product with the DataFrame.

`Series.mul`

    
Multiplication of series and other, element-wise.

Notes

The Series and other has to share the same index if other is a Series or a
DataFrame.

Examples

    
    >>> s = pd.Series([0, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> other = pd.Series([-1, 2, -3, 4])
    >>> s.dot(other)
    8
    >>> s @ other
    8
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame([[0, 1], [-2, 3], [4, -5], [6, 7]])
    >>> s.dot(df)
    0    24
    1    14
    dtype: int64
    >>> arr = np.array([[0, 1], [-2, 3], [4, -5], [6, 7]])
    >>> s.dot(arr)
    array([24, 14])
