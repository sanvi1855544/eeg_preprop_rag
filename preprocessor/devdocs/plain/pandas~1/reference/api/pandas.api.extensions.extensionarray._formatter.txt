# pandas.api.extensions.ExtensionArray._formatter

ExtensionArray._formatter(boxed=False)[source]

    
Formatting function for scalar values.

This is used in the default ‘__repr__’. The returned formatting function
receives instances of your scalar type.

Parameters

    
boxed:bool, default False

    
An indicated for whether or not your array is being printed within a Series,
DataFrame, or Index (True), or just by itself (False). This may be useful if
you want scalar values to appear differently within a Series versus on its own
(e.g. quoted or not).

Returns

    
Callable[[Any], str]

    
A callable that gets instances of the scalar type and returns a string. By
default, `repr()` is used when `boxed=False` and `str()` is used when
`boxed=True`.
