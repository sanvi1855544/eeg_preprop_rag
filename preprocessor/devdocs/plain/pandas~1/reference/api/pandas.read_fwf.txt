# pandas.read_fwf

pandas.read_fwf(filepath_or_buffer, colspecs='infer', widths=None,
infer_nrows=100, **kwds)[source]

    
Read a table of fixed-width formatted lines into DataFrame.

Also supports optionally iterating or breaking of the file into chunks.

Additional help can be found in the online docs for IO Tools.

Parameters

    
filepath_or_buffer:str, path object, or file-like object

    
String, path object (implementing `os.PathLike[str]`), or file-like object
implementing a text `read()` function.The string could be a URL. Valid URL
schemes include http, ftp, s3, and file. For file URLs, a host is expected. A
local file could be: `file://localhost/path/to/table.csv`.

colspecs:list of tuple (int, int) or ‘infer’. optional

    
A list of tuples giving the extents of the fixed-width fields of each line as
half-open intervals (i.e., [from, to[ ). String value ‘infer’ can be used to
instruct the parser to try detecting the column specifications from the first
100 rows of the data which are not being skipped via skiprows
(default=’infer’).

widths:list of int, optional

    
A list of field widths which can be used instead of ‘colspecs’ if the
intervals are contiguous.

infer_nrows:int, default 100

    
The number of rows to consider when letting the parser determine the colspecs.

**kwds:optional

    
Optional keyword arguments can be passed to `TextFileReader`.

Returns

    
DataFrame or TextFileReader

    
A comma-separated values (csv) file is returned as two-dimensional data
structure with labeled axes.
