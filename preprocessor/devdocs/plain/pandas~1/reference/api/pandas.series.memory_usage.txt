# pandas.Series.memory_usage

Series.memory_usage(index=True, deep=False)[source]

    
Return the memory usage of the Series.

The memory usage can optionally include the contribution of the index and of
elements of object dtype.

Parameters

    
index:bool, default True

    
Specifies whether to include the memory usage of the Series index.

deep:bool, default False

    
If True, introspect the data deeply by interrogating object dtypes for system-
level memory consumption, and include it in the returned value.

Returns

    
int

    
Bytes of memory consumed.

See also

`numpy.ndarray.nbytes`

    
Total bytes consumed by the elements of the array.

`DataFrame.memory_usage`

    
Bytes consumed by a DataFrame.

Examples

    
    >>> s = pd.Series(range(3))
    >>> s.memory_usage()
    152
    
Not including the index gives the size of the rest of the data, which is
necessarily smaller:

    
    >>> s.memory_usage(index=False)
    24
    
The memory footprint of object values is ignored by default:

    
    >>> s = pd.Series(["a", "b"])
    >>> s.values
    array(['a', 'b'], dtype=object)
    >>> s.memory_usage()
    144
    >>> s.memory_usage(deep=True)
    244
