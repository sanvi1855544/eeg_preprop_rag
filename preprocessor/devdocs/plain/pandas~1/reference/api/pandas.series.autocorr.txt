# pandas.Series.autocorr

Series.autocorr(lag=1)[source]

    
Compute the lag-N autocorrelation.

This method computes the Pearson correlation between the Series and its
shifted self.

Parameters

    
lag:int, default 1

    
Number of lags to apply before performing autocorrelation.

Returns

    
float

    
The Pearson correlation between self and self.shift(lag).

See also

`Series.corr`

    
Compute the correlation between two Series.

`Series.shift`

    
Shift index by desired number of periods.

`DataFrame.corr`

    
Compute pairwise correlation of columns.

`DataFrame.corrwith`

    
Compute pairwise correlation between rows or columns of two DataFrame objects.

Notes

If the Pearson correlation is not well defined return ‘NaN’.

Examples

    
    >>> s = pd.Series([0.25, 0.5, 0.2, -0.05])
    >>> s.autocorr()  
    0.10355...
    >>> s.autocorr(lag=2)  
    -0.99999...
    
If the Pearson correlation is not well defined, then ‘NaN’ is returned.

    
    >>> s = pd.Series([1, 0, 0, 0])
    >>> s.autocorr()
    nan
