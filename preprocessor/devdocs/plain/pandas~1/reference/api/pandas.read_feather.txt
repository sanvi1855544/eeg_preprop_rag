# pandas.read_feather

pandas.read_feather(path, columns=None, use_threads=True,
storage_options=None)[source]

    
Load a feather-format object from the file path.

Parameters

    
path:str, path object, or file-like object

    
String, path object (implementing `os.PathLike[str]`), or file-like object
implementing a binary `read()` function. The string could be a URL. Valid URL
schemes include http, ftp, s3, and file. For file URLs, a host is expected. A
local file could be: `file://localhost/path/to/table.feather`.

columns:sequence, default None

    
If not provided, all columns are read.

use_threads:bool, default True

    
Whether to parallelize reading using multiple threads.

storage_options:dict, optional

    
Extra options that make sense for a particular storage connection, e.g. host,
port, username, password, etc. For HTTP(S) URLs the key-value pairs are
forwarded to `urllib` as header options. For other URLs (e.g. starting with
“s3://”, and “gcs://”) the key-value pairs are forwarded to `fsspec`. Please
see `fsspec` and `urllib` for more details.

New in version 1.2.0.

Returns

    
type of object stored in file
