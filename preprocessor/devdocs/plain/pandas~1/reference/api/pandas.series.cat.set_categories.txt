# pandas.Series.cat.set_categories

Series.cat.set_categories(*args, **kwargs)[source]

    
Set the categories to the specified new_categories.

new_categories can include new categories (which will result in unused
categories) or remove old categories (which results in values set to NaN). If
rename==True, the categories will simple be renamed (less or more items than
in old categories will result in values set to NaN or in unused categories
respectively).

This method can be used to perform more than one action of adding, removing,
and reordering simultaneously and is therefore faster than performing the
individual steps via the more specialised methods.

On the other hand this methods does not do checks (e.g., whether the old
categories are included in the new categories on a reorder), which can result
in surprising changes, for example when using special string dtypes, which
does not considers a S1 string equal to a single char python string.

Parameters

    
new_categories:Index-like

    
The categories in new order.

ordered:bool, default False

    
Whether or not the categorical is treated as a ordered categorical. If not
given, do not change the ordered information.

rename:bool, default False

    
Whether or not the new_categories should be considered as a rename of the old
categories or as reordered categories.

inplace:bool, default False

    
Whether or not to reorder the categories in-place or return a copy of this
categorical with reordered categories.

Deprecated since version 1.3.0.

Returns

    
Categorical with reordered categories or None if inplace.

Raises

    
ValueError

    
If new_categories does not validate as categories
