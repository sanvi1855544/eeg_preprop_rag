# pandas.Series.combine_first

Series.combine_first(other)[source]

    
Update null elements with value in the same location in ‘other’.

Combine two Series objects by filling null values in one Series with non-null
values from the other Series. Result index will be the union of the two
indexes.

Parameters

    
other:Series

    
The value(s) to be used for filling null values.

Returns

    
Series

    
The result of combining the provided Series with the other object.

Perform element-wise operation on two Series using a given function.

Examples

    
    >>> s1 = pd.Series([1, np.nan])
    >>> s2 = pd.Series([3, 4, 5])
    >>> s1.combine_first(s2)
    0    1.0
    1    4.0
    2    5.0
    dtype: float64
    
Null values still persist if the location of that null value does not exist in
other

    
    >>> s1 = pd.Series({'falcon': np.nan, 'eagle': 160.0})
    >>> s2 = pd.Series({'eagle': 200.0, 'duck': 30.0})
    >>> s1.combine_first(s2)
    duck       30.0
    eagle     160.0
    falcon      NaN
    dtype: float64
