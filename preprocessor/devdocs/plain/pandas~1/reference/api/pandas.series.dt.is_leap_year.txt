# pandas.Series.dt.is_leap_year

Series.dt.is_leap_year

    
Boolean indicator if the date belongs to a leap year.

A leap year is a year, which has 366 days (instead of 365) including 29th of
February as an intercalary day. Leap years are years which are multiples of
four with the exception of years divisible by 100 but not by 400.

Returns

    
Series or ndarray

    
Booleans indicating if dates belong to a leap year.

Examples

This method is available on Series with datetime values under the `.dt`
accessor, and directly on DatetimeIndex.

    
    >>> idx = pd.date_range("2012-01-01", "2015-01-01", freq="Y")
    >>> idx
    DatetimeIndex(['2012-12-31', '2013-12-31', '2014-12-31'],
                  dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='A-DEC')
    >>> idx.is_leap_year
    array([ True, False, False])
    
    
    >>> dates_series = pd.Series(idx)
    >>> dates_series
    0   2012-12-31
    1   2013-12-31
    2   2014-12-31
    dtype: datetime64[ns]
    >>> dates_series.dt.is_leap_year
