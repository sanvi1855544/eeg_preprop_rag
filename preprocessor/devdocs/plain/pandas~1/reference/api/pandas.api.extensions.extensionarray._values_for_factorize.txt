# pandas.api.extensions.ExtensionArray._values_for_factorize

ExtensionArray._values_for_factorize()[source]

    
Return an array and missing value suitable for factorization.

Returns

    
values:ndarray

    
An array suitable for factorization. This should maintain order and be a
supported dtype (Float64, Int64, UInt64, String, Object). By default, the
extension array is cast to object dtype.

na_value:object

    
The value in values to consider missing. This will be treated as NA in the
factorization routines, so it will be coded as na_sentinel and not included in
uniques. By default, `np.nan` is used.

Notes

The values returned by this method are also used in
`pandas.util.hash_pandas_object()`.
