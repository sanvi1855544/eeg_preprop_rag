# pandas.Series.view

Series.view(dtype=None)[source]

    
Create a new view of the Series.

This function will return a new Series with a view of the same underlying
values in memory, optionally reinterpreted with a new data type. The new data
type must preserve the same size in bytes as to not cause index misalignment.

Parameters

    
dtype:data type

    
Data type object or one of their string representations.

Returns

    
Series

    
A new Series object as a view of the same data in memory.

See also

`numpy.ndarray.view`

    
Equivalent numpy function to create a new view of the same data in memory.

Notes

Series are instantiated with `dtype=float64` by default. While
`numpy.ndarray.view()` will return a view with the same data type as the
original array, `Series.view()` (without specified dtype) will try using
`float64` and may fail if the original data type size in bytes is not the
same.

Examples

    
    >>> s = pd.Series([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2], dtype='int8')
    >>> s
    0   -2
    1   -1
    2    0
    3    1
    4    2
    dtype: int8
    
The 8 bit signed integer representation of -1 is 0b11111111, but the same
bytes represent 255 if read as an 8 bit unsigned integer:

    
    >>> us = s.view('uint8')
    >>> us
    0    254
    1    255
    2      0
    3      1
    4      2
    dtype: uint8
    
The views share the same underlying values:

    
    >>> us[0] = 128
    >>> s
    0   -128
    1     -1
    2      0
    3      1
    4      2
    dtype: int8
