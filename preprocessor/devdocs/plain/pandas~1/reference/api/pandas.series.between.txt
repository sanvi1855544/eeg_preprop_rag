# pandas.Series.between

Series.between(left, right, inclusive='both')[source]

    
Return boolean Series equivalent to left <= series <= right.

This function returns a boolean vector containing True wherever the
corresponding Series element is between the boundary values left and right. NA
values are treated as False.

Parameters

    
left:scalar or list-like

    
Left boundary.

right:scalar or list-like

    
Right boundary.

inclusive:{“both”, “neither”, “left”, “right”}

    
Include boundaries. Whether to set each bound as closed or open.

Changed in version 1.3.0.

Returns

    
Series

    
Series representing whether each element is between left and right
(inclusive).

See also

`Series.gt`

    
Greater than of series and other.

`Series.lt`

    
Less than of series and other.

Notes

This function is equivalent to `(left <= ser) & (ser <= right)`

Examples

    
    >>> s = pd.Series([2, 0, 4, 8, np.nan])
    
Boundary values are included by default:

    
    >>> s.between(1, 4)
    0     True
    1    False
    2     True
    3    False
    4    False
    dtype: bool
    
With inclusive set to `"neither"` boundary values are excluded:

    
    >>> s.between(1, 4, inclusive="neither")
    0     True
    1    False
    2    False
    3    False
    4    False
    dtype: bool
    
left and right can be any scalar value:

    
    >>> s = pd.Series(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Eve'])
    >>> s.between('Anna', 'Daniel')
    0    False
    1     True
    2     True
    3    False
    dtype: bool
