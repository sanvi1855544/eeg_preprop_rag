# pandas.DatetimeIndex.to_series

DatetimeIndex.to_series(keep_tz=NoDefault.no_default, index=None,
name=None)[source]

    
Create a Series with both index and values equal to the index keys useful with
map for returning an indexer based on an index.

Parameters

    
keep_tz:optional, defaults True

    
Return the data keeping the timezone.

If keep_tz is True:

> If the timezone is not set, the resulting Series will have a datetime64[ns]
> dtype.
> Otherwise the Series will have an datetime64[ns, tz] dtype; the tz will be
> preserved.
If keep_tz is False:

> Series will have a datetime64[ns] dtype. TZ aware objects will have the tz
> removed.
Changed in version 1.0.0: The default value is now True. In a future version,
this keyword will be removed entirely. Stop passing the argument to obtain the
future behavior and silence the warning.

index:Index, optional

    
Index of resulting Series. If None, defaults to original index.

name:str, optional

    
Name of resulting Series. If None, defaults to name of original index.

Returns

    
Series
