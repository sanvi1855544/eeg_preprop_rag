# pandas.Series.argsort

Series.argsort(axis=0, kind='quicksort', order=None)[source]

    
Return the integer indices that would sort the Series values.

Override ndarray.argsort. Argsorts the value, omitting NA/null values, and
places the result in the same locations as the non-NA values.

Parameters

    
axis:{0 or “index”}

    
Has no effect but is accepted for compatibility with numpy.

kind:{‘mergesort’, ‘quicksort’, ‘heapsort’, ‘stable’}, default ‘quicksort’

    
Choice of sorting algorithm. See `numpy.sort()` for more information.
‘mergesort’ and ‘stable’ are the only stable algorithms.

order:None

    
Has no effect but is accepted for compatibility with numpy.

Returns

    
Series[np.intp]

    
Positions of values within the sort order with -1 indicating nan values.
