# pandas.IntervalIndex.is_overlapping

propertyIntervalIndex.is_overlapping

    
Return True if the IntervalIndex has overlapping intervals, else False.

Two intervals overlap if they share a common point, including closed
endpoints. Intervals that only have an open endpoint in common do not overlap.

Returns

    
bool

    
Boolean indicating if the IntervalIndex has overlapping intervals.

Check whether two Interval objects overlap.

`IntervalIndex.overlaps`

    
Check an IntervalIndex elementwise for overlaps.

Examples

    
    >>> index = pd.IntervalIndex.from_tuples([(0, 2), (1, 3), (4, 5)])
    >>> index
    IntervalIndex([(0, 2], (1, 3], (4, 5]],
          dtype='interval[int64, right]')
    >>> index.is_overlapping
    True
    
Intervals that share closed endpoints overlap:

    
    >>> index = pd.interval_range(0, 3, closed='both')
    >>> index
    IntervalIndex([[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]],
          dtype='interval[int64, both]')
    >>> index.is_overlapping
    True
    
Intervals that only have an open endpoint in common do not overlap:

    
    >>> index = pd.interval_range(0, 3, closed='left')
    >>> index
    IntervalIndex([[0, 1), [1, 2), [2, 3)],
          dtype='interval[int64, left]')
    >>> index.is_overlapping
    False
