# pandas.Interval.overlaps

Interval.overlaps()

    
Check whether two Interval objects overlap.

Two intervals overlap if they share a common point, including closed
endpoints. Intervals that only have an open endpoint in common do not overlap.

Parameters

    
other:Interval

    
Interval to check against for an overlap.

Returns

    
bool

    
True if the two intervals overlap.

The corresponding method for IntervalArray.

`IntervalIndex.overlaps`

    
The corresponding method for IntervalIndex.

Examples

    
    >>> i1 = pd.Interval(0, 2)
    >>> i2 = pd.Interval(1, 3)
    >>> i1.overlaps(i2)
    True
    >>> i3 = pd.Interval(4, 5)
    >>> i1.overlaps(i3)
    False
    
Intervals that share closed endpoints overlap:

    
    >>> i4 = pd.Interval(0, 1, closed='both')
    >>> i5 = pd.Interval(1, 2, closed='both')
    >>> i4.overlaps(i5)
    True
    
Intervals that only have an open endpoint in common do not overlap:

    
    >>> i6 = pd.Interval(1, 2, closed='neither')
    >>> i4.overlaps(i6)
    False
