# pandas.Series.diff

Series.diff(periods=1)[source]

    
First discrete difference of element.

Calculates the difference of a Series element compared with another element in
the Series (default is element in previous row).

Parameters

    
periods:int, default 1

    
Periods to shift for calculating difference, accepts negative values.

Returns

    
Series

    
First differences of the Series.

See also

`Series.pct_change`

    
Percent change over given number of periods.

`Series.shift`

    
Shift index by desired number of periods with an optional time freq.

`DataFrame.diff`

    
First discrete difference of object.

Notes

For boolean dtypes, this uses `operator.xor()` rather than `operator.sub()`.
The result is calculated according to current dtype in Series, however dtype
of the result is always float64.

Examples

Difference with previous row

    
    >>> s = pd.Series([1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8])
    >>> s.diff()
    0    NaN
    1    0.0
    2    1.0
    3    1.0
    4    2.0
    5    3.0
    dtype: float64
    
Difference with 3rd previous row

    
    >>> s.diff(periods=3)
    0    NaN
    1    NaN
    2    NaN
    3    2.0
    4    4.0
    5    6.0
    dtype: float64
    
Difference with following row

    
    >>> s.diff(periods=-1)
    0    0.0
    1   -1.0
    2   -1.0
    3   -2.0
    4   -3.0
    5    NaN
    dtype: float64
    
Overflow in input dtype

    
    >>> s = pd.Series([1, 0], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> s.diff()
    0      NaN
    1    255.0
    dtype: float64
