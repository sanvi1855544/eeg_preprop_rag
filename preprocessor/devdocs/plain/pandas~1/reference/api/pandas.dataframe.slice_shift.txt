# pandas.DataFrame.slice_shift

DataFrame.slice_shift(periods=1, axis=0)[source]

    
Equivalent to shift without copying data. The shifted data will not include
the dropped periods and the shifted axis will be smaller than the original.

Deprecated since version 1.2.0: slice_shift is deprecated, use
DataFrame/Series.shift instead.

Parameters

    
periods:int

    
Number of periods to move, can be positive or negative.

Returns

    
shifted:same type as caller

Notes

While the slice_shift is faster than shift, you may pay for it later during
alignment.
