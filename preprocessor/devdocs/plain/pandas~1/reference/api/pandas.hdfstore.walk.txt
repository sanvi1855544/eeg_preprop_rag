# pandas.HDFStore.walk

HDFStore.walk(where='/')[source]

    
Walk the pytables group hierarchy for pandas objects.

This generator will yield the group path, subgroups and pandas object names
for each group.

Any non-pandas PyTables objects that are not a group will be ignored.

The where group itself is listed first (preorder), then each of its child
groups (following an alphanumerical order) is also traversed, following the
same procedure.

Parameters

    
where:str, default “/”

    
Group where to start walking.

Yields

    
path:str

    
Full path to a group (without trailing ‘/’).

groups:list

    
Names (strings) of the groups contained in path.

leaves:list

    
Names (strings) of the pandas objects contained in path.
