# pandas.Series.str.extract

Series.str.extract(pat, flags=0, expand=True)[source]

    
Extract capture groups in the regex pat as columns in a DataFrame.

For each subject string in the Series, extract groups from the first match of
regular expression pat.

Parameters

    
pat:str

    
Regular expression pattern with capturing groups.

flags:int, default 0 (no flags)

    
Flags from the `re` module, e.g. `re.IGNORECASE`, that modify regular
expression matching for things like case, spaces, etc. For more details, see
`re`.

expand:bool, default True

    
If True, return DataFrame with one column per capture group. If False, return
a Series/Index if there is one capture group or DataFrame if there are
multiple capture groups.

Returns

    
DataFrame or Series or Index

    
A DataFrame with one row for each subject string, and one column for each
group. Any capture group names in regular expression pat will be used for
column names; otherwise capture group numbers will be used. The dtype of each
result column is always object, even when no match is found. If `expand=False`
and pat has only one capture group, then return a Series (if subject is a
Series) or Index (if subject is an Index).

`extractall`

    
Returns all matches (not just the first match).

Examples

A pattern with two groups will return a DataFrame with two columns. Non-
matches will be NaN.

    
    >>> s = pd.Series(['a1', 'b2', 'c3'])
    >>> s.str.extract(r'([ab])(\d)')
        0    1
    0    a    1
    1    b    2
    2  NaN  NaN
    
A pattern may contain optional groups.

    
    >>> s.str.extract(r'([ab])?(\d)')
        0  1
    0    a  1
    1    b  2
    2  NaN  3
    
Named groups will become column names in the result.

    
    >>> s.str.extract(r'(?P<letter>[ab])(?P<digit>\d)')
    letter digit
    0      a     1
    1      b     2
    2    NaN   NaN
    
A pattern with one group will return a DataFrame with one column if
expand=True.

    
    >>> s.str.extract(r'[ab](\d)', expand=True)
        0
    0    1
    1    2
    2  NaN
    
A pattern with one group will return a Series if expand=False.

    
    >>> s.str.extract(r'[ab](\d)', expand=False)
    0      1
    1      2
    2    NaN
    dtype: object
