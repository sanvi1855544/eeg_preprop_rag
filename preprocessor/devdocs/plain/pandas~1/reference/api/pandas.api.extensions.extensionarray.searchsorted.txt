# pandas.api.extensions.ExtensionArray.searchsorted

ExtensionArray.searchsorted(value, side='left', sorter=None)[source]

    
Find indices where elements should be inserted to maintain order.

Find the indices into a sorted array self (a) such that, if the corresponding
elements in value were inserted before the indices, the order of self would be
preserved.

Assuming that self is sorted:

side | returned index i satisfies  
---|---  
left | `self[i-1] < value <= self[i]`  
right | `self[i-1] <= value < self[i]`  
Parameters

    
value:array-like, list or scalar

    
Value(s) to insert into self.

side:{‘left’, ‘right’}, optional

    
If ‘left’, the index of the first suitable location found is given. If
‘right’, return the last such index. If there is no suitable index, return
either 0 or N (where N is the length of self).

sorter:1-D array-like, optional

    
Optional array of integer indices that sort array a into ascending order. They
are typically the result of argsort.

Returns

    
array of ints or int

    
If value is array-like, array of insertion points. If value is scalar, a
single integer.
