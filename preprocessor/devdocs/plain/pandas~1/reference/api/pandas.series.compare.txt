# pandas.Series.compare

Series.compare(other, align_axis=1, keep_shape=False,
keep_equal=False)[source]

    
Compare to another Series and show the differences.

New in version 1.1.0.

Parameters

    
other:Series

    
Object to compare with.

align_axis:{0 or ‘index’, 1 or ‘columns’}, default 1

    
Determine which axis to align the comparison on.

  * 0, or ‘index’:Resulting differences are stacked vertically
    
with rows drawn alternately from self and other.

  * 1, or ‘columns’:Resulting differences are aligned horizontally
    
with columns drawn alternately from self and other.

keep_shape:bool, default False

    
If true, all rows and columns are kept. Otherwise, only the ones with
different values are kept.

keep_equal:bool, default False

    
If true, the result keeps values that are equal. Otherwise, equal values are
shown as NaNs.

Returns

    
Series or DataFrame

    
If axis is 0 or ‘index’ the result will be a Series. The resulting index will
be a MultiIndex with ‘self’ and ‘other’ stacked alternately at the inner
level.

If axis is 1 or ‘columns’ the result will be a DataFrame. It will have two
columns namely ‘self’ and ‘other’.

`DataFrame.compare`

    
Compare with another DataFrame and show differences.

Notes

Matching NaNs will not appear as a difference.

Examples

    
    >>> s1 = pd.Series(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"])
    >>> s2 = pd.Series(["a", "a", "c", "b", "e"])
    
Align the differences on columns

    
    >>> s1.compare(s2)
      self other
    1    b     a
    3    d     b
    
Stack the differences on indices

    
    >>> s1.compare(s2, align_axis=0)
    1  self     b
       other    a
    3  self     d
       other    b
    dtype: object
    
Keep all original rows

    
    >>> s1.compare(s2, keep_shape=True)
      self other
    0  NaN   NaN
    1    b     a
    2  NaN   NaN
    3    d     b
    4  NaN   NaN
    
Keep all original rows and also all original values

    
    >>> s1.compare(s2, keep_shape=True, keep_equal=True)
      self other
    0    a     a
    1    b     a
    2    c     c
    3    d     b
    4    e     e
