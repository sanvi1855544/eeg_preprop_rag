# pandas.DataFrame.round

DataFrame.round(decimals=0, *args, **kwargs)[source]

    
Round a DataFrame to a variable number of decimal places.

Parameters

    
decimals:int, dict, Series

    
Number of decimal places to round each column to. If an int is given, round
each column to the same number of places. Otherwise dict and Series round to
variable numbers of places. Column names should be in the keys if decimals is
a dict-like, or in the index if decimals is a Series. Any columns not included
in decimals will be left as is. Elements of decimals which are not columns of
the input will be ignored.

*args
    
Additional keywords have no effect but might be accepted for compatibility
with numpy.

**kwargs

    
Additional keywords have no effect but might be accepted for compatibility
with numpy.

Returns

    
DataFrame

    
A DataFrame with the affected columns rounded to the specified number of
decimal places.

Examples

    
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame([(.21, .32), (.01, .67), (.66, .03), (.21, .18)],
    ...                   columns=['dogs', 'cats'])
    >>> df
        dogs  cats
    0  0.21  0.32
    1  0.01  0.67
    2  0.66  0.03
    3  0.21  0.18
    
By providing an integer each column is rounded to the same number of decimal
places

    
    >>> df.round(1)
        dogs  cats
    0   0.2   0.3
    1   0.0   0.7
    2   0.7   0.0
    3   0.2   0.2
    
With a dict, the number of places for specific columns can be specified with
the column names as key and the number of decimal places as value

    
    >>> df.round({'dogs': 1, 'cats': 0})
        dogs  cats
    0   0.2   0.0
    1   0.0   1.0
    2   0.7   0.0
    3   0.2   0.0
    
Using a Series, the number of places for specific columns can be specified
with the column names as index and the number of decimal places as value

    
    >>> decimals = pd.Series([0, 1], index=['cats', 'dogs'])
    >>> df.round(decimals)
        dogs  cats
    0   0.2   0.0
    1   0.0   1.0
    2   0.7   0.0
    3   0.2   0.0
