# pandas.Index.astype

Index.astype(dtype, copy=True)[source]

    
Create an Index with values cast to dtypes.

The class of a new Index is determined by dtype. When conversion is
impossible, a TypeError exception is raised.

Parameters

    
dtype:numpy dtype or pandas type

    
Note that any signed integer dtype is treated as `'int64'`, and any unsigned
integer dtype is treated as `'uint64'`, regardless of the size.

copy:bool, default True

    
By default, astype always returns a newly allocated object. If copy is set to
False and internal requirements on dtype are satisfied, the original data is
used to create a new Index or the original Index is returned.

Returns

    
Index

    
Index with values cast to specified dtype.
