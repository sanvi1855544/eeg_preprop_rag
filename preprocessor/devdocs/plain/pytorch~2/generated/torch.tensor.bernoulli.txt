# torch.Tensor.bernoulli

`Tensor.bernoulli(*, generator=None) → Tensor`

    
Returns a result tensor where each result[i]\texttt{result[i]} is
independently sampled from
Bernoulli(self[i])\text{Bernoulli}(\texttt{self[i]}). `self` must have
floating point `dtype`, and the result will have the same `dtype`.
