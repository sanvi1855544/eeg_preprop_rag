# torch.geqrf

`torch.geqrf(input, *, out=None)`

    
This is a low-level function for calling LAPACK’s geqrf directly. This
function returns a namedtuple (a, tau) as defined in LAPACK documentation for
geqrf .

Computes a QR decomposition of `input`. Both `Q` and `R` matrices are stored
in the same output tensor `a`. The elements of `R` are stored on and above the
diagonal. Elementary reflectors (or Householder vectors) implicitly defining
matrix `Q` are stored below the diagonal. The results of this function can be
used together with `torch.linalg.householder_product()` to obtain the `Q`
matrix or with `torch.ormqr()`, which uses an implicit representation of the
`Q` matrix, for an efficient matrix-matrix multiplication.

See LAPACK documentation for geqrf for further details.

Note

See also `torch.linalg.qr()`, which computes Q and R matrices, and
`torch.linalg.lstsq()` with the `driver="gels"` option for a function that can
solve matrix equations using a QR decomposition.

Parameters

    
input (Tensor) – the input matrix

Keyword Arguments

    
out (tuple, optional) – the output tuple of (Tensor, Tensor). Ignored if
`None`. Default: `None`.
