# torch.Tensor.values

`Tensor.values() → Tensor`

    
Return the values tensor of a sparse COO tensor.

Warning

Throws an error if `self` is not a sparse COO tensor.

See also `Tensor.indices()`.

Note

This method can only be called on a coalesced sparse tensor. See
`Tensor.coalesce()` for details.
