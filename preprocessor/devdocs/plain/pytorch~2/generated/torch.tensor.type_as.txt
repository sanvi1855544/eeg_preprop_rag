# torch.Tensor.type_as

`Tensor.type_as(tensor) → Tensor`

    
Returns this tensor cast to the type of the given tensor.

This is a no-op if the tensor is already of the correct type. This is
equivalent to `self.type(tensor.type())`

Parameters

    
tensor (Tensor) – the tensor which has the desired type
