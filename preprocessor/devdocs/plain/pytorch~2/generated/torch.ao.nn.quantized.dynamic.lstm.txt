# LSTM

`class torch.ao.nn.quantized.dynamic.LSTM(*args, **kwargs)` [source]

    
A dynamic quantized LSTM module with floating point tensor as inputs and
outputs. We adopt the same interface as `torch.nn.LSTM`, please see
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.LSTM for documentation.

Examples:

    
    >>> rnn = nn.LSTM(10, 20, 2)
    >>> input = torch.randn(5, 3, 10)
    >>> h0 = torch.randn(2, 3, 20)
    >>> c0 = torch.randn(2, 3, 20)
    >>> output, (hn, cn) = rnn(input, (h0, c0))
