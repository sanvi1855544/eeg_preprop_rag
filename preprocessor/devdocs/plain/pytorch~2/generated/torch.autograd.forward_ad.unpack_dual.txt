# torch.autograd.forward_ad.unpack_dual

`torch.autograd.forward_ad.unpack_dual(tensor, *, level=None)` [source]

    
Unpacks a “dual tensor” to get both its Tensor value and its forward AD
gradient. The result is a namedtuple `(primal, tangent)` where `primal` is a
view of `tensor`’s primal and `tangent` is `tensor`’s tangent as-is. Neither
of these tensors can be dual tensor of level `level`.

This function is backward differentiable.

Example:

    
    >>> with dual_level():
    ...     inp = make_dual(x, x_t)
    ...     out = f(inp)
    ...     y, jvp = unpack_dual(out)
    ...     jvp = unpack_dual(out).tangent
    
Please see the forward-mode AD tutorial for detailed steps on how to use this
API.
