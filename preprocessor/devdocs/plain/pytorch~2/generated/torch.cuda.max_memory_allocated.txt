# torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated

`torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated(device=None)` [source]

    
Returns the maximum GPU memory occupied by tensors in bytes for a given
device.

By default, this returns the peak allocated memory since the beginning of this
program. `reset_peak_memory_stats()` can be used to reset the starting point
in tracking this metric. For example, these two functions can measure the peak
allocated memory usage of each iteration in a training loop.

Parameters

    
device (torch.device or int, optional) – selected device. Returns statistic
for the current device, given by `current_device()`, if `device` is `None`
(default).

Return type

    
int

Note

See Memory management for more details about GPU memory management.
