# torch.select_scatter

`torch.select_scatter(input, src, dim, index) → Tensor`

    
Embeds the values of the `src` tensor into `input` at the given index. This
function returns a tensor with fresh storage; it does not create a view.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the input tensor.
  * src (Tensor) – The tensor to embed into `input`
  * dim (int) – the dimension to insert the slice into.
  * index (int) – the index to select with

Note

`src` must be of the proper size in order to be embedded into `input`.
Specifically, it should have the same shape as `torch.select(input, dim,
index)`

Example:

    
    >>> a = torch.zeros(2, 2)
    >>> b = torch.ones(2)
    >>> a.select_scatter(b, 0, 0)
    tensor([[1., 1.],
            [0., 0.]])
