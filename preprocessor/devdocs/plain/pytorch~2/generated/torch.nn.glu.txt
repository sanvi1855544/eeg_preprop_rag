# GLU

`class torch.nn.GLU(dim=-1)` [source]

    
Applies the gated linear unit function GLU(a,b)=a⊗σ(b){GLU}(a, b)= a \otimes
\sigma(b) where aa is the first half of the input matrices and bb is the
second half.

Parameters

    
dim (int) – the dimension on which to split the input. Default: -1

Shape:

    
  * Input: (∗1,N,∗2)(\ast_1, N, \ast_2) where `*` means, any number of additional dimensions
  * Output: (∗1,M,∗2)(\ast_1, M, \ast_2) where M=N/2M=N/2

Examples:

    
    >>> m = nn.GLU()
    >>> input = torch.randn(4, 2)
    >>> output = m(input)
