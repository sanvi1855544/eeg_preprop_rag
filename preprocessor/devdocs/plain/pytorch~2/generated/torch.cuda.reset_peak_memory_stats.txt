# torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats

`torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats(device=None)` [source]

    
Resets the “peak” stats tracked by the CUDA memory allocator.

See `memory_stats()` for details. Peak stats correspond to the `“peak”` key in
each individual stat dict.

Parameters

    
device (torch.device or int, optional) – selected device. Returns statistic
for the current device, given by `current_device()`, if `device` is `None`
(default).

Note

See Memory management for more details about GPU memory management.
