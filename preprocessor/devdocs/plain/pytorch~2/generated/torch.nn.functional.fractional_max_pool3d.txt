# torch.nn.functional.fractional_max_pool3d

`torch.nn.functional.fractional_max_pool3d(input, kernel_size,
output_size=None, output_ratio=None, return_indices=False,
_random_samples=None)`

    
Applies 3D fractional max pooling over an input signal composed of several
input planes.

Fractional MaxPooling is described in detail in the paper Fractional
MaxPooling by Ben Graham

The max-pooling operation is applied in kT×kH×kWkT \times kH \times kW regions
by a stochastic step size determined by the target output size. The number of
output features is equal to the number of input planes.

Parameters

    
  * kernel_size – the size of the window to take a max over. Can be a single number kk (for a square kernel of k×k×kk \times k \times k) or a tuple `(kT, kH, kW)`
  * output_size – the target output size of the form oT×oH×oWoT \times oH \times oW. Can be a tuple `(oT, oH, oW)` or a single number oHoH for a cubic output oH×oH×oHoH \times oH \times oH
  * output_ratio – If one wants to have an output size as a ratio of the input size, this option can be given. This has to be a number or tuple in the range (0, 1)
  * return_indices – if `True`, will return the indices along with the outputs. Useful to pass to `max_unpool3d()`.

Shape:

    
  * Input: (N,C,Tin,Hin,Win)(N, C, T_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in}) or (C,Tin,Hin,Win)(C, T_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in}).
  * Output: (N,C,Tout,Hout,Wout)(N, C, T_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out}) or (C,Tout,Hout,Wout)(C, T_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out}), where (Tout,Hout,Wout)=output_size(T_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out})=\text{output\\_size} or (Tout,Hout,Wout)=output_ratio×(Tin,Hin,Win)(T_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out})=\text{output\\_ratio} \times (T_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})

Examples::

    
    
    >>> input = torch.randn(20, 16, 50, 32, 16)
    >>> # pool of cubic window of size=3, and target output size 13x12x11
    >>> F.fractional_max_pool3d(input, 3, output_size=(13, 12, 11))
    >>> # pool of cubic window and target output size being half of input size
    >>> F.fractional_max_pool3d(input, 3, output_ratio=(0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
