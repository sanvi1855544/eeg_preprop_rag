# torch.Tensor.reshape_as

`Tensor.reshape_as(other) → Tensor`

    
Returns this tensor as the same shape as `other`. `self.reshape_as(other)` is
equivalent to `self.reshape(other.sizes())`. This method returns a view if
`other.sizes()` is compatible with the current shape. See
`torch.Tensor.view()` on when it is possible to return a view.

Please see `reshape()` for more information about `reshape`.

Parameters

    
other (`torch.Tensor`) – The result tensor has the same shape as `other`.
