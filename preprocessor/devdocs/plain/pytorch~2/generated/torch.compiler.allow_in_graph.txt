# torch.compiler.allow_in_graph

`torch.compiler.allow_in_graph(fn)` [source]

    
Customize which functions compilation will include in the generated graph. It
bypasses all introspection of the symbolic python code in favor of directly
writing it to the graph. If fn is a list or tuple of callables it recursively
applies `allow_in_graph()` to each function and returns a new list or tuple
containing the modified functions

Parameters

    
fn – A callable representing the function to be included in the graph.

Warning

`allow_in_graph()` skips TorchDynamo completely on the decorated function
skipping all TorchDynamo safety checks (graph breaks, handling closures, etc).
Therefore, one has to be very careful with `allow_in_graph()` since subsystems
like AOT Autograd rely on torchdynamo If not careful, this could lead to
soundness and really hard-to-debug issues.
