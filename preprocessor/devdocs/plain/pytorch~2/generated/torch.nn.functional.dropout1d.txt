# torch.nn.functional.dropout1d

`torch.nn.functional.dropout1d(input, p=0.5, training=True, inplace=False)`
[source]

    
Randomly zero out entire channels (a channel is a 1D feature map, e.g., the
jj-th channel of the ii-th sample in the batched input is a 1D tensor
input[i,j]\text{input}[i, j]) of the input tensor). Each channel will be
zeroed out independently on every forward call with probability `p` using
samples from a Bernoulli distribution.

See `Dropout1d` for details.

Parameters

    
  * p (float) – probability of a channel to be zeroed. Default: 0.5
  * training (bool) – apply dropout if is `True`. Default: `True`
  * inplace (bool) – If set to `True`, will do this operation in-place. Default: `False`

Return type

    
Tensor
