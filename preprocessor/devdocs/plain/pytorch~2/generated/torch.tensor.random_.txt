# torch.Tensor.random_

`Tensor.random_(from=0, to=None, *, generator=None) → Tensor`

    
Fills `self` tensor with numbers sampled from the discrete uniform
distribution over `[from, to - 1]`. If not specified, the values are usually
only bounded by `self` tensor’s data type. However, for floating point types,
if unspecified, range will be `[0, 2^mantissa]` to ensure that every value is
representable. For example, `torch.tensor(1, dtype=torch.double).random_()`
will be uniform in `[0, 2^53]`.
