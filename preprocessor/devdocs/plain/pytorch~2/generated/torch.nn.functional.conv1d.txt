# torch.nn.functional.conv1d

`torch.nn.functional.conv1d(input, weight, bias=None, stride=1, padding=0,
dilation=1, groups=1) → Tensor`

    
Applies a 1D convolution over an input signal composed of several input
planes.

This operator supports TensorFloat32.

See `Conv1d` for details and output shape.

Note

In some circumstances when given tensors on a CUDA device and using CuDNN,
this operator may select a nondeterministic algorithm to increase performance.
If this is undesirable, you can try to make the operation deterministic
(potentially at a performance cost) by setting
`torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True`. See Reproducibility for more
information.

Note

This operator supports complex data types i.e. `complex32, complex64,
complex128`.

Parameters

    
  * input – input tensor of shape (minibatch,in_channels,iW)(\text{minibatch} , \text{in\\_channels} , iW)
  * weight – filters of shape (out_channels,in_channelsgroups,kW)(\text{out\\_channels} , \frac{\text{in\\_channels}}{\text{groups}} , kW)
  * bias – optional bias of shape (out_channels)(\text{out\\_channels}). Default: `None`
  * stride – the stride of the convolving kernel. Can be a single number or a one-element tuple `(sW,)`. Default: 1
  * padding – 
implicit paddings on both sides of the input. Can be a string {‘valid’,
‘same’}, single number or a one-element tuple `(padW,)`. Default: 0
`padding='valid'` is the same as no padding. `padding='same'` pads the input
so the output has the same shape as the input. However, this mode doesn’t
support any stride values other than 1.

Warning

For `padding='same'`, if the `weight` is even-length and `dilation` is odd in
any dimension, a full `pad()` operation may be needed internally. Lowering
performance.

  * dilation – the spacing between kernel elements. Can be a single number or a one-element tuple `(dW,)`. Default: 1
  * groups – split input into groups, in_channels\text{in\\_channels} should be divisible by the number of groups. Default: 1

Examples:

    
    >>> inputs = torch.randn(33, 16, 30)
    >>> filters = torch.randn(20, 16, 5)
    >>> F.conv1d(inputs, filters)
