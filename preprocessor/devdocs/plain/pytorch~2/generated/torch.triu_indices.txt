# torch.triu_indices

`torch.triu_indices(row, col, offset=0, *, dtype=torch.long, device='cpu',
layout=torch.strided) → Tensor`

    
Returns the indices of the upper triangular part of a `row` by `col` matrix in
a 2-by-N Tensor, where the first row contains row coordinates of all indices
and the second row contains column coordinates. Indices are ordered based on
rows and then columns.

The upper triangular part of the matrix is defined as the elements on and
above the diagonal.

The argument `offset` controls which diagonal to consider. If `offset` = 0,
all elements on and above the main diagonal are retained. A positive value
excludes just as many diagonals above the main diagonal, and similarly a
negative value includes just as many diagonals below the main diagonal. The
main diagonal are the set of indices {(i,i)}\lbrace (i, i) \rbrace for
i∈[0,min⁡{d1,d2}−1]i \in [0, \min\\{d_{1}, d_{2}\\} - 1] where d1,d2d_{1},
d_{2} are the dimensions of the matrix.

Note

When running on CUDA, `row * col` must be less than 2592^{59} to prevent
overflow during calculation.

Parameters

    
  * row (`int`) – number of rows in the 2-D matrix.
  * col (`int`) – number of columns in the 2-D matrix.
  * offset (`int`) – diagonal offset from the main diagonal. Default: if not provided, 0.

Keyword Arguments

    
  * dtype (`torch.dtype`, optional) – the desired data type of returned tensor. Default: if `None`, `torch.long`.
  * device (`torch.device`, optional) – the desired device of returned tensor. Default: if `None`, uses the current device for the default tensor type (see `torch.set_default_tensor_type()`). `device` will be the CPU for CPU tensor types and the current CUDA device for CUDA tensor types.
  * layout (`torch.layout`, optional) – currently only support `torch.strided`.

Example:

    
    >>> a = torch.triu_indices(3, 3)
    >>> a
    tensor([[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2],
            [0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2]])
    
    >>> a = torch.triu_indices(4, 3, -1)
    >>> a
    tensor([[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3],
            [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2]])
    
    >>> a = torch.triu_indices(4, 3, 1)
    >>> a
    tensor([[0, 0, 1],
            [1, 2, 2]])
