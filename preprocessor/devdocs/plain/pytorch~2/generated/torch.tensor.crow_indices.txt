# torch.Tensor.crow_indices

`Tensor.crow_indices() → IntTensor`

    
Returns the tensor containing the compressed row indices of the `self` tensor
when `self` is a sparse CSR tensor of layout `sparse_csr`. The `crow_indices`
tensor is strictly of shape (`self`.size(0) + 1) and of type `int32` or
`int64`. When using MKL routines such as sparse matrix multiplication, it is
necessary to use `int32` indexing in order to avoid downcasting and
potentially losing information.

Example::

    
    
    >>> csr = torch.eye(5,5).to_sparse_csr()
    >>> csr.crow_indices()
    tensor([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype=torch.int32)
