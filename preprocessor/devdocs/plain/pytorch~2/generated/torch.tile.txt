# torch.tile

`torch.tile(input, dims) → Tensor`

    
Constructs a tensor by repeating the elements of `input`. The `dims` argument
specifies the number of repetitions in each dimension.

If `dims` specifies fewer dimensions than `input` has, then ones are prepended
to `dims` until all dimensions are specified. For example, if `input` has
shape (8, 6, 4, 2) and `dims` is (2, 2), then `dims` is treated as (1, 1, 2,
2).

Analogously, if `input` has fewer dimensions than `dims` specifies, then
`input` is treated as if it were unsqueezed at dimension zero until it has as
many dimensions as `dims` specifies. For example, if `input` has shape (4, 2)
and `dims` is (3, 3, 2, 2), then `input` is treated as if it had the shape (1,
1, 4, 2).

Note

This function is similar to NumPy’s tile function.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the tensor whose elements to repeat.
  * dims (tuple) – the number of repetitions per dimension.

Example:

    
    >>> x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
    >>> x.tile((2,))
    tensor([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3])
    >>> y = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> torch.tile(y, (2, 2))
    tensor([[1, 2, 1, 2],
            [3, 4, 3, 4],
            [1, 2, 1, 2],
            [3, 4, 3, 4]])
