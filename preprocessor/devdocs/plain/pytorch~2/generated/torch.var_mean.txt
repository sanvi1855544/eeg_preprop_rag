# torch.var_mean

`torch.var_mean(input, dim=None, *, correction=1, keepdim=False, out=None)`

    
Calculates the variance and mean over the dimensions specified by `dim`. `dim`
can be a single dimension, list of dimensions, or `None` to reduce over all
dimensions.

The variance (σ2\sigma^2) is calculated as

σ2=1max⁡(0,N−δN)∑i=0N−1(xi−xˉ)2\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{\max(0,~N - \delta
N)}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}(x_i-\bar{x})^2

where xx is the sample set of elements, xˉ\bar{x} is the sample mean, NN is
the number of samples and δN\delta N is the `correction`.

If `keepdim` is `True`, the output tensor is of the same size as `input`
except in the dimension(s) `dim` where it is of size 1. Otherwise, `dim` is
squeezed (see `torch.squeeze()`), resulting in the output tensor having 1 (or
`len(dim)`) fewer dimension(s).

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the input tensor.
  * dim (int or tuple of ints, optional) – the dimension or dimensions to reduce. If `None`, all dimensions are reduced.

Keyword Arguments

    
  * correction (int) – 
difference between the sample size and sample degrees of freedom. Defaults to
Bessel’s correction, `correction=1`.

Changed in version 2.0: Previously this argument was called `unbiased` and was
a boolean with `True` corresponding to `correction=1` and `False` being
`correction=0`.

  * keepdim (bool) – whether the output tensor has `dim` retained or not.
  * out (Tensor, optional) – the output tensor.

Returns

    
A tuple (var, mean) containing the variance and mean.

#### Example

    
    >>> a = torch.tensor(
    ...     [[ 0.2035,  1.2959,  1.8101, -0.4644],
    ...      [ 1.5027, -0.3270,  0.5905,  0.6538],
    ...      [-1.5745,  1.3330, -0.5596, -0.6548],
    ...      [ 0.1264, -0.5080,  1.6420,  0.1992]])
    >>> torch.var_mean(a, dim=0, keepdim=True)
    (tensor([[1.5926, 1.0056, 1.2005, 0.3646]]),
     tensor([[ 0.0645,  0.4485,  0.8707, -0.0665]]))
