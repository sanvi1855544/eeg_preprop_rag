# prepare_qat

`class torch.ao.quantization.prepare_qat(model, mapping=None, inplace=False)`
[source]

    
Prepares a copy of the model for quantization calibration or quantization-
aware training and converts it to quantized version.

Quantization configuration should be assigned preemptively to individual
submodules in `.qconfig` attribute.

Parameters

    
  * model – input model to be modified in-place
  * mapping – dictionary that maps float modules to quantized modules to be replaced.
  * inplace – carry out model transformations in-place, the original module is mutated
