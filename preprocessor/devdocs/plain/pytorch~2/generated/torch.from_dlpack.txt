# torch.from_dlpack

`torch.from_dlpack(ext_tensor) → Tensor` [source]

    
Converts a tensor from an external library into a `torch.Tensor`.

The returned PyTorch tensor will share the memory with the input tensor (which
may have come from another library). Note that in-place operations will
therefore also affect the data of the input tensor. This may lead to
unexpected issues (e.g., other libraries may have read-only flags or immutable
data structures), so the user should only do this if they know for sure that
this is fine.

Parameters

    
ext_tensor (object with `__dlpack__` attribute, or a DLPack capsule) –

The tensor or DLPack capsule to convert.

If `ext_tensor` is a tensor (or ndarray) object, it must support the
`__dlpack__` protocol (i.e., have a `ext_tensor.__dlpack__` method). Otherwise
`ext_tensor` may be a DLPack capsule, which is an opaque `PyCapsule` instance,
typically produced by a `to_dlpack` function or method.

Return type

    
Tensor

Examples:

    
    >>> import torch.utils.dlpack
    >>> t = torch.arange(4)
    
    # Convert a tensor directly (supported in PyTorch >= 1.10)
    >>> t2 = torch.from_dlpack(t)
    >>> t2[:2] = -1  # show that memory is shared
    >>> t2
    tensor([-1, -1,  2,  3])
    >>> t
    tensor([-1, -1,  2,  3])
    
    # The old-style DLPack usage, with an intermediate capsule object
    >>> capsule = torch.utils.dlpack.to_dlpack(t)
    >>> capsule
    <capsule object "dltensor" at ...>
    >>> t3 = torch.from_dlpack(capsule)
    >>> t3
    tensor([-1, -1,  2,  3])
    >>> t3[0] = -9  # now we're sharing memory between 3 tensors
    >>> t3
    tensor([-9, -1,  2,  3])
    >>> t2
    tensor([-9, -1,  2,  3])
    >>> t
    tensor([-9, -1,  2,  3])
