# torch.Tensor.stride

`Tensor.stride(dim) → tuple or int`

    
Returns the stride of `self` tensor.

Stride is the jump necessary to go from one element to the next one in the
specified dimension `dim`. A tuple of all strides is returned when no argument
is passed in. Otherwise, an integer value is returned as the stride in the
particular dimension `dim`.

Parameters

    
dim (int, optional) – the desired dimension in which stride is required

Example:

    
    >>> x = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])
    >>> x.stride()
    (5, 1)
    >>> x.stride(0)
    5
    >>> x.stride(-1)
    1
