# torch.broadcast_tensors

`torch.broadcast_tensors(*tensors) → List of Tensors` [source]

    
Broadcasts the given tensors according to Broadcasting semantics.

Parameters

    
*tensors – any number of tensors of the same type
Warning

More than one element of a broadcasted tensor may refer to a single memory
location. As a result, in-place operations (especially ones that are
vectorized) may result in incorrect behavior. If you need to write to the
tensors, please clone them first.

Example:

    
    >>> x = torch.arange(3).view(1, 3)
    >>> y = torch.arange(2).view(2, 1)
    >>> a, b = torch.broadcast_tensors(x, y)
    >>> a.size()
    torch.Size([2, 3])
    >>> a
    tensor([[0, 1, 2],
            [0, 1, 2]])
