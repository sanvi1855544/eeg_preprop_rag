# torch.as_strided

`torch.as_strided(input, size, stride, storage_offset=None) → Tensor`

    
Create a view of an existing `torch.Tensor` `input` with specified `size`,
`stride` and `storage_offset`.

Warning

Prefer using other view functions, like `torch.Tensor.expand()`, to setting a
view’s strides manually with `as_strided`, as this function’s behavior depends
on the implementation of a tensor’s storage. The constructed view of the
storage must only refer to elements within the storage or a runtime error will
be thrown, and if the view is “overlapped” (with multiple indices referring to
the same element in memory) its behavior is undefined.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the input tensor.
  * size (tuple or ints) – the shape of the output tensor
  * stride (tuple or ints) – the stride of the output tensor
  * storage_offset (int, optional) – the offset in the underlying storage of the output tensor. If `None`, the storage_offset of the output tensor will match the input tensor.

Example:

    
    >>> x = torch.randn(3, 3)
    >>> x
    tensor([[ 0.9039,  0.6291,  1.0795],
            [ 0.1586,  2.1939, -0.4900],
            [-0.1909, -0.7503,  1.9355]])
    >>> t = torch.as_strided(x, (2, 2), (1, 2))
    >>> t
    tensor([[0.9039, 1.0795],
            [0.6291, 0.1586]])
    >>> t = torch.as_strided(x, (2, 2), (1, 2), 1)
    tensor([[0.6291, 0.1586],
            [1.0795, 2.1939]])
