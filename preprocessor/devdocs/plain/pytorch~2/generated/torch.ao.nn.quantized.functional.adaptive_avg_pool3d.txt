# adaptive_avg_pool3d

`class torch.ao.nn.quantized.functional.adaptive_avg_pool3d(input,
output_size)` [source]

    
Applies a 3D adaptive average pooling over a quantized input signal composed
of several quantized input planes.

Note

The input quantization parameters propagate to the output.

See `AdaptiveAvgPool3d` for details and output shape.

Parameters

    
output_size (None) – the target output size (single integer or double-integer
tuple)

Return type

    
Tensor
