# torch.Tensor.add

`Tensor.add(other, *, alpha=1) → Tensor`

    
Add a scalar or tensor to `self` tensor. If both `alpha` and `other` are
specified, each element of `other` is scaled by `alpha` before being used.

When `other` is a tensor, the shape of `other` must be broadcastable with the
shape of the underlying tensor

See `torch.add()`
