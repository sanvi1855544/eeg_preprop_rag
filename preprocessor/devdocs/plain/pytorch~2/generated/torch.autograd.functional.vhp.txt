# torch.autograd.functional.vhp

`torch.autograd.functional.vhp(func, inputs, v=None, create_graph=False,
strict=False)` [source]

    
Function that computes the dot product between a vector `v` and the Hessian of
a given scalar function at the point given by the inputs.

Parameters

    
  * func (function) – a Python function that takes Tensor inputs and returns a Tensor with a single element.
  * inputs (tuple of Tensors or Tensor) – inputs to the function `func`.
  * v (tuple of Tensors or Tensor) – The vector for which the vector Hessian product is computed. Must be the same size as the input of `func`. This argument is optional when `func`’s input contains a single element and (if it is not provided) will be set as a Tensor containing a single `1`.
  * create_graph (bool, optional) – If `True`, both the output and result will be computed in a differentiable way. Note that when `strict` is `False`, the result can not require gradients or be disconnected from the inputs. Defaults to `False`.
  * strict (bool, optional) – If `True`, an error will be raised when we detect that there exists an input such that all the outputs are independent of it. If `False`, we return a Tensor of zeros as the vhp for said inputs, which is the expected mathematical value. Defaults to `False`.

Returns

    
tuple with:

    
func_output (tuple of Tensors or Tensor): output of `func(inputs)`

vhp (tuple of Tensors or Tensor): result of the dot product with the same
shape as the inputs.

Return type

    
output (tuple)

#### Example

    
    >>> def pow_reducer(x):
    ...     return x.pow(3).sum()
    >>> inputs = torch.rand(2, 2)
    >>> v = torch.ones(2, 2)
    >>> vhp(pow_reducer, inputs, v)
    (tensor(0.5591),
     tensor([[1.0689, 1.2431],
             [3.0989, 4.4456]]))
    >>> vhp(pow_reducer, inputs, v, create_graph=True)
    (tensor(0.5591, grad_fn=<SumBackward0>),
     tensor([[1.0689, 1.2431],
             [3.0989, 4.4456]], grad_fn=<MulBackward0>))
    >>> def pow_adder_reducer(x, y):
    ...     return (2 * x.pow(2) + 3 * y.pow(2)).sum()
    >>> inputs = (torch.rand(2), torch.rand(2))
    >>> v = (torch.zeros(2), torch.ones(2))
    >>> vhp(pow_adder_reducer, inputs, v)
    (tensor(4.8053),
     (tensor([0., 0.]),
      tensor([6., 6.])))
