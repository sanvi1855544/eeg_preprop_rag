# UninitializedBuffer

`class torch.nn.parameter.UninitializedBuffer(requires_grad=False,
device=None, dtype=None)` [source]

    
A buffer that is not initialized.

Uninitialized Buffer is a a special case of `torch.Tensor` where the shape of
the data is still unknown.

Unlike a `torch.Tensor`, uninitialized parameters hold no data and attempting
to access some properties, like their shape, will throw a runtime error. The
only operations that can be performed on a uninitialized parameter are
changing its datatype, moving it to a different device and converting it to a
regular `torch.Tensor`.

The default device or dtype to use when the buffer is materialized can be set
during construction using e.g. `device='cuda'`.
