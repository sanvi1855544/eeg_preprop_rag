# torch.Tensor.cpu

`Tensor.cpu(memory_format=torch.preserve_format) → Tensor`

    
Returns a copy of this object in CPU memory.

If this object is already in CPU memory and on the correct device, then no
copy is performed and the original object is returned.

Parameters

    
memory_format (`torch.memory_format`, optional) – the desired memory format of
returned Tensor. Default: `torch.preserve_format`.
