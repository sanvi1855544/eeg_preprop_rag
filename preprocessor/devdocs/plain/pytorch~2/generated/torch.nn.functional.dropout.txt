# torch.nn.functional.dropout

`torch.nn.functional.dropout(input, p=0.5, training=True, inplace=False)`
[source]

    
During training, randomly zeroes some of the elements of the input tensor with
probability `p` using samples from a Bernoulli distribution.

See `Dropout` for details.

Parameters

    
  * p (float) – probability of an element to be zeroed. Default: 0.5
  * training (bool) – apply dropout if is `True`. Default: `True`
  * inplace (bool) – If set to `True`, will do this operation in-place. Default: `False`

Return type

    
Tensor
