# Dropout3d

`class torch.nn.Dropout3d(p=0.5, inplace=False)` [source]

    
Randomly zero out entire channels (a channel is a 3D feature map, e.g., the
jj-th channel of the ii-th sample in the batched input is a 3D tensor
input[i,j]\text{input}[i, j]). Each channel will be zeroed out independently
on every forward call with probability `p` using samples from a Bernoulli
distribution.

Usually the input comes from `nn.Conv3d` modules.

As described in the paper Efficient Object Localization Using Convolutional
Networks , if adjacent pixels within feature maps are strongly correlated (as
is normally the case in early convolution layers) then i.i.d. dropout will not
regularize the activations and will otherwise just result in an effective
learning rate decrease.

In this case, `nn.Dropout3d()` will help promote independence between feature
maps and should be used instead.

Parameters

    
  * p (float, optional) – probability of an element to be zeroed.
  * inplace (bool, optional) – If set to `True`, will do this operation in-place

Shape:

    
  * Input: (N,C,D,H,W)(N, C, D, H, W) or (C,D,H,W)(C, D, H, W).
  * Output: (N,C,D,H,W)(N, C, D, H, W) or (C,D,H,W)(C, D, H, W) (same shape as input).

Examples:

    
    >>> m = nn.Dropout3d(p=0.2)
    >>> input = torch.randn(20, 16, 4, 32, 32)
    >>> output = m(input)
