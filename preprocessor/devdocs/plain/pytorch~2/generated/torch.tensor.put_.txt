# torch.Tensor.put_

`Tensor.put_(index, source, accumulate=False) → Tensor`

    
Copies the elements from `source` into the positions specified by `index`. For
the purpose of indexing, the `self` tensor is treated as if it were a 1-D
tensor.

`index` and `source` need to have the same number of elements, but not
necessarily the same shape.

If `accumulate` is `True`, the elements in `source` are added to `self`. If
accumulate is `False`, the behavior is undefined if `index` contain duplicate
elements.

Parameters

    
  * index (LongTensor) – the indices into self
  * source (Tensor) – the tensor containing values to copy from
  * accumulate (bool) – whether to accumulate into self

Example:

    
    >>> src = torch.tensor([[4, 3, 5],
    ...                     [6, 7, 8]])
    >>> src.put_(torch.tensor([1, 3]), torch.tensor([9, 10]))
    tensor([[  4,   9,   5],
            [ 10,   7,   8]])
