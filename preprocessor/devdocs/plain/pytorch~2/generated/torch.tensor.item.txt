# torch.Tensor.item

`Tensor.item() → number`

    
Returns the value of this tensor as a standard Python number. This only works
for tensors with one element. For other cases, see `tolist()`.

This operation is not differentiable.

Example:

    
    >>> x = torch.tensor([1.0])
    >>> x.item()
    1.0
