# torch.autograd.profiler.profile.key_averages

`profile.key_averages(group_by_input_shape=False, group_by_stack_n=0)`
[source]

    
Averages all function events over their keys.

Parameters

    
  * group_by_input_shapes – group entries by (event name, input shapes) rather than just event name. This is useful to see which input shapes contribute to the runtime the most and may help with size-specific optimizations or choosing the best candidates for quantization (aka fitting a roof line)
  * group_by_stack_n – group by top n stack trace entries

Returns

    
An EventList containing FunctionEventAvg objects.
