# FuseCustomConfig

`class torch.ao.quantization.fx.custom_config.FuseCustomConfig` [source]

    
Custom configuration for `fuse_fx()`.

Example usage:

    
    fuse_custom_config = FuseCustomConfig().set_preserved_attributes(["attr1", "attr2"])
    
`classmethod from_dict(fuse_custom_config_dict)` [source]

    
Create a `ConvertCustomConfig` from a dictionary with the following items:

“preserved_attributes”: a list of attributes that persist even if they are not
used in `forward`

This function is primarily for backward compatibility and may be removed in
the future.

Return type

    
FuseCustomConfig

`set_preserved_attributes(attributes)` [source]

    
Set the names of the attributes that will persist in the graph module even if
they are not used in the model’s `forward` method.

Return type

    
FuseCustomConfig

`to_dict()` [source]

    
Convert this `FuseCustomConfig` to a dictionary with the items described in
`from_dict()`.

Return type

    
Dict[str, Any]
