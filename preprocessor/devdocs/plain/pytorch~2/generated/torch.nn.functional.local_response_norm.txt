# torch.nn.functional.local_response_norm

`torch.nn.functional.local_response_norm(input, size, alpha=0.0001, beta=0.75,
k=1.0)` [source]

    
Applies local response normalization over an input signal composed of several
input planes, where channels occupy the second dimension. Applies
normalization across channels.

See `LocalResponseNorm` for details.
