# FakeQuantizeBase

`class torch.ao.quantization.fake_quantize.FakeQuantizeBase` [source]

    
Base fake quantize module Any fake quantize implementation should derive from
this class.

Concrete fake quantize module should follow the same API. In forward, they
will update the statistics of the observed Tensor and fake quantize the input.
They should also provide a `calculate_qparams` function that computes the
quantization parameters given the collected statistics.
