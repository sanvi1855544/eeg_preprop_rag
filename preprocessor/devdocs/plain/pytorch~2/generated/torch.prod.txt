# torch.prod

`torch.prod(input, *, dtype=None) → Tensor`

    
Returns the product of all elements in the `input` tensor.

Parameters

    
input (Tensor) – the input tensor.

Keyword Arguments

    
dtype (`torch.dtype`, optional) – the desired data type of returned tensor. If
specified, the input tensor is casted to `dtype` before the operation is
performed. This is useful for preventing data type overflows. Default: None.

Example:

    
    >>> a = torch.randn(1, 3)
    >>> a
    tensor([[-0.8020,  0.5428, -1.5854]])
    >>> torch.prod(a)
    tensor(0.6902)
    
torch.prod(input, dim, keepdim=False, *, dtype=None) → Tensor

Returns the product of each row of the `input` tensor in the given dimension
`dim`.

If `keepdim` is `True`, the output tensor is of the same size as `input`
except in the dimension `dim` where it is of size 1. Otherwise, `dim` is
squeezed (see `torch.squeeze()`), resulting in the output tensor having 1
fewer dimension than `input`.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the input tensor.
  * dim (int) – the dimension to reduce.
  * keepdim (bool) – whether the output tensor has `dim` retained or not.

Keyword Arguments

    
dtype (`torch.dtype`, optional) – the desired data type of returned tensor. If
specified, the input tensor is casted to `dtype` before the operation is
performed. This is useful for preventing data type overflows. Default: None.

Example:

    
    >>> a = torch.randn(4, 2)
    >>> a
    tensor([[ 0.5261, -0.3837],
            [ 1.1857, -0.2498],
            [-1.1646,  0.0705],
            [ 1.1131, -1.0629]])
    >>> torch.prod(a, 1)
    tensor([-0.2018, -0.2962, -0.0821, -1.1831])
