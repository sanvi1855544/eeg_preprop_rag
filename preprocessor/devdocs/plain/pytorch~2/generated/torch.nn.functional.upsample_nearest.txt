# torch.nn.functional.upsample_nearest

`torch.nn.functional.upsample_nearest(input, size=None, scale_factor=None)`
[source]

    
Upsamples the input, using nearest neighbours’ pixel values.

Warning

This function is deprecated in favor of `torch.nn.functional.interpolate()`.
This is equivalent with `nn.functional.interpolate(..., mode='nearest')`.

Currently spatial and volumetric upsampling are supported (i.e. expected
inputs are 4 or 5 dimensional).

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – input
  * size (int or Tuple[int, int] or Tuple[int, int, int]) – output spatia size.
  * scale_factor (int) – multiplier for spatial size. Has to be an integer.

Note

This operation may produce nondeterministic gradients when given tensors on a
CUDA device. See Reproducibility for more information.
