# torch.mps.set_per_process_memory_fraction

`torch.mps.set_per_process_memory_fraction(fraction)` [source]

    
Set memory fraction for limiting process’s memory allocation on MPS device.
The allowed value equals the fraction multiplied by recommended maximum device
memory (obtained from Metal API device.recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize). If
trying to allocate more than the allowed value in a process, it will raise an
out of memory error in allocator.

Parameters

    
fraction (float) – Range: 0~2. Allowed memory equals total_memory * fraction.

Note

Passing 0 to fraction means unlimited allocations (may cause system failure if
out of memory). Passing fraction greater than 1.0 allows limits beyond the
value returned from device.recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize.
