# torch.Tensor.set_

`Tensor.set_(source=None, storage_offset=0, size=None, stride=None) → Tensor`

    
Sets the underlying storage, size, and strides. If `source` is a tensor,
`self` tensor will share the same storage and have the same size and strides
as `source`. Changes to elements in one tensor will be reflected in the other.

If `source` is a `Storage`, the method sets the underlying storage, offset,
size, and stride.

Parameters

    
  * source (Tensor or Storage) – the tensor or storage to use
  * storage_offset (int, optional) – the offset in the storage
  * size (torch.Size, optional) – the desired size. Defaults to the size of the source.
  * stride (tuple, optional) – the desired stride. Defaults to C-contiguous strides.
