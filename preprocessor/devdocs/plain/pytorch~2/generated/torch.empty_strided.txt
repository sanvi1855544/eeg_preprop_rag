# torch.empty_strided

`torch.empty_strided(size, stride, *, dtype=None, layout=None, device=None,
requires_grad=False, pin_memory=False) → Tensor`

    
Creates a tensor with the specified `size` and `stride` and filled with
undefined data.

Warning

If the constructed tensor is “overlapped” (with multiple indices referring to
the same element in memory) its behavior is undefined.

Note

If `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms()` is set to `True`, the output tensor
is initialized to prevent any possible nondeterministic behavior from using
the data as an input to an operation. Floating point and complex tensors are
filled with NaN, and integer tensors are filled with the maximum value.

Parameters

    
  * size (tuple of int) – the shape of the output tensor
  * stride (tuple of int) – the strides of the output tensor

Keyword Arguments

    
  * dtype (`torch.dtype`, optional) – the desired data type of returned tensor. Default: if `None`, uses a global default (see `torch.set_default_tensor_type()`).
  * layout (`torch.layout`, optional) – the desired layout of returned Tensor. Default: `torch.strided`.
  * device (`torch.device`, optional) – the desired device of returned tensor. Default: if `None`, uses the current device for the default tensor type (see `torch.set_default_tensor_type()`). `device` will be the CPU for CPU tensor types and the current CUDA device for CUDA tensor types.
  * requires_grad (bool, optional) – If autograd should record operations on the returned tensor. Default: `False`.
  * pin_memory (bool, optional) – If set, returned tensor would be allocated in the pinned memory. Works only for CPU tensors. Default: `False`.

Example:

    
    >>> a = torch.empty_strided((2, 3), (1, 2))
    >>> a
    tensor([[8.9683e-44, 4.4842e-44, 5.1239e+07],
            [0.0000e+00, 0.0000e+00, 3.0705e-41]])
    >>> a.stride()
    (1, 2)
    >>> a.size()
    torch.Size([2, 3])
