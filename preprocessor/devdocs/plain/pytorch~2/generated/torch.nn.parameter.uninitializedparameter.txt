# UninitializedParameter

`class torch.nn.parameter.UninitializedParameter(requires_grad=True,
device=None, dtype=None)` [source]

    
A parameter that is not initialized.

Uninitialized Parameters are a a special case of `torch.nn.Parameter` where
the shape of the data is still unknown.

Unlike a `torch.nn.Parameter`, uninitialized parameters hold no data and
attempting to access some properties, like their shape, will throw a runtime
error. The only operations that can be performed on a uninitialized parameter
are changing its datatype, moving it to a different device and converting it
to a regular `torch.nn.Parameter`.

The default device or dtype to use when the parameter is materialized can be
set during construction using e.g. `device='cuda'`.
