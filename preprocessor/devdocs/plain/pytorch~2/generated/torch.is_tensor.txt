# torch.is_tensor

`torch.is_tensor(obj)` [source]

    
Returns True if `obj` is a PyTorch tensor.

Note that this function is simply doing `isinstance(obj, Tensor)`. Using that
`isinstance` check is better for typechecking with mypy, and more explicit -
so it’s recommended to use that instead of `is_tensor`.

Parameters

    
obj (Object) – Object to test

Example:

    
    >>> x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
    >>> torch.is_tensor(x)
    True
