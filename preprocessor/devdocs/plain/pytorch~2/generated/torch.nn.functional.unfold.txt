# torch.nn.functional.unfold

`torch.nn.functional.unfold(input, kernel_size, dilation=1, padding=0,
stride=1)` [source]

    
Extracts sliding local blocks from a batched input tensor.

Warning

Currently, only 4-D input tensors (batched image-like tensors) are supported.

Warning

More than one element of the unfolded tensor may refer to a single memory
location. As a result, in-place operations (especially ones that are
vectorized) may result in incorrect behavior. If you need to write to the
tensor, please clone it first.

See `torch.nn.Unfold` for details

Return type

    
Tensor
