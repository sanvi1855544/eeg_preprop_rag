# Conv2d

`class torch.ao.nn.qat.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size,
stride=1, padding=0, dilation=1, groups=1, bias=True, padding_mode='zeros',
qconfig=None, device=None, dtype=None)` [source]

    
A Conv2d module attached with FakeQuantize modules for weight, used for
quantization aware training.

We adopt the same interface as `torch.nn.Conv2d`, please see
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html?highlight=conv2d#torch.nn.Conv2d for
documentation.

Similar to `torch.nn.Conv2d`, with FakeQuantize modules initialized to
default.

Variables

    
weight_fake_quant – fake quant module for weight
