# ConvReLU3d

`class torch.ao.nn.intrinsic.qat.ConvReLU3d(in_channels, out_channels,
kernel_size, stride=1, padding=0, dilation=1, groups=1, bias=True,
padding_mode='zeros', qconfig=None)` [source]

    
A ConvReLU3d module is a fused module of Conv3d and ReLU, attached with
FakeQuantize modules for weight for quantization aware training.

We combined the interface of `Conv3d` and `BatchNorm3d`.

Variables

    
weight_fake_quant – fake quant module for weight
