# torch.atan2

`torch.atan2(input, other, *, out=None) → Tensor`

    
Element-wise arctangent of inputi/otheri\text{input}_{i} / \text{other}_{i}
with consideration of the quadrant. Returns a new tensor with the signed
angles in radians between vector (otheri,inputi)(\text{other}_{i},
\text{input}_{i}) and vector (1,0)(1, 0). (Note that otheri\text{other}_{i},
the second parameter, is the x-coordinate, while inputi\text{input}_{i}, the
first parameter, is the y-coordinate.)

The shapes of `input` and `other` must be broadcastable.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the first input tensor
  * other (Tensor) – the second input tensor

Keyword Arguments

    
out (Tensor, optional) – the output tensor.

Example:

    
    >>> a = torch.randn(4)
    >>> a
    tensor([ 0.9041,  0.0196, -0.3108, -2.4423])
    >>> torch.atan2(a, torch.randn(4))
    tensor([ 0.9833,  0.0811, -1.9743, -1.4151])
