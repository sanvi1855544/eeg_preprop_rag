# torch.Tensor.col_indices

`Tensor.col_indices() → IntTensor`

    
Returns the tensor containing the column indices of the `self` tensor when
`self` is a sparse CSR tensor of layout `sparse_csr`. The `col_indices` tensor
is strictly of shape (`self`.nnz()) and of type `int32` or `int64`. When using
MKL routines such as sparse matrix multiplication, it is necessary to use
`int32` indexing in order to avoid downcasting and potentially losing
information.

Example::

    
    
    >>> csr = torch.eye(5,5).to_sparse_csr()
    >>> csr.col_indices()
    tensor([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=torch.int32)
