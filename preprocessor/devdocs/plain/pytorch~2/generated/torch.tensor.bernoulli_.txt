# torch.Tensor.bernoulli_

`Tensor.bernoulli_(p=0.5, *, generator=None) → Tensor`

    
Fills each location of `self` with an independent sample from
Bernoulli(p)\text{Bernoulli}(\texttt{p}). `self` can have integral `dtype`.

`p` should either be a scalar or tensor containing probabilities to be used
for drawing the binary random number.

If it is a tensor, the ith\text{i}^{th} element of `self` tensor will be set
to a value sampled from
Bernoulli(p_tensor[i])\text{Bernoulli}(\texttt{p\\_tensor[i]}). In this case
`p` must have floating point `dtype`.
