# torch.Tensor.copy_

`Tensor.copy_(src, non_blocking=False) → Tensor`

    
Copies the elements from `src` into `self` tensor and returns `self`.

The `src` tensor must be broadcastable with the `self` tensor. It may be of a
different data type or reside on a different device.

Parameters

    
  * src (Tensor) – the source tensor to copy from
  * non_blocking (bool) – if `True` and this copy is between CPU and GPU, the copy may occur asynchronously with respect to the host. For other cases, this argument has no effect.
