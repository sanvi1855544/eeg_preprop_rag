# AdaptiveAvgPool2d

`class torch.nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size)` [source]

    
Applies a 2D adaptive average pooling over an input signal composed of several
input planes.

The output is of size H x W, for any input size. The number of output features
is equal to the number of input planes.

Parameters

    
output_size (Union[int, None, Tuple[Optional[int], Optional[int]]]) – the
target output size of the image of the form H x W. Can be a tuple (H, W) or a
single H for a square image H x H. H and W can be either a `int`, or `None`
which means the size will be the same as that of the input.

Shape:

    
  * Input: (N,C,Hin,Win)(N, C, H_{in}, W_{in}) or (C,Hin,Win)(C, H_{in}, W_{in}).
  * Output: (N,C,S0,S1)(N, C, S_{0}, S_{1}) or (C,S0,S1)(C, S_{0}, S_{1}), where S=output_sizeS=\text{output\\_size}.

#### Examples

    
    >>> # target output size of 5x7
    >>> m = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((5, 7))
    >>> input = torch.randn(1, 64, 8, 9)
    >>> output = m(input)
    >>> # target output size of 7x7 (square)
    >>> m = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(7)
    >>> input = torch.randn(1, 64, 10, 9)
    >>> output = m(input)
    >>> # target output size of 10x7
    >>> m = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((None, 7))
    >>> input = torch.randn(1, 64, 10, 9)
    >>> output = m(input)
