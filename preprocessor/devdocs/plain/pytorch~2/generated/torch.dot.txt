# torch.dot

`torch.dot(input, other, *, out=None) → Tensor`

    
Computes the dot product of two 1D tensors.

Note

Unlike NumPy’s dot, torch.dot intentionally only supports computing the dot
product of two 1D tensors with the same number of elements.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – first tensor in the dot product, must be 1D.
  * other (Tensor) – second tensor in the dot product, must be 1D.

Keyword Arguments

    
out (Tensor, optional) – the output tensor.

Example:

    
    >>> torch.dot(torch.tensor([2, 3]), torch.tensor([2, 1]))
    tensor(7)
