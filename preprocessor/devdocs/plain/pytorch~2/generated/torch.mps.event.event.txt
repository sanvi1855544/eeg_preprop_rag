# Event

`class torch.mps.event.Event(enable_timing=False)` [source]

    
Wrapper around an MPS event.

MPS events are synchronization markers that can be used to monitor the
device’s progress, to accurately measure timing, and to synchronize MPS
streams.

Parameters

    
enable_timing (bool, optional) – indicates if the event should measure time
(default: `False`)

`elapsed_time(end_event)` [source]

    
Returns the time elapsed in milliseconds after the event was recorded and
before the end_event was recorded.

`query()` [source]

    
Returns True if all work currently captured by event has completed.

`record()` [source]

    
Records the event in the default stream.

`synchronize()` [source]

    
Waits until the completion of all work currently captured in this event. This
prevents the CPU thread from proceeding until the event completes.

`wait()` [source]

    
Makes all future work submitted to the default stream wait for this event.
