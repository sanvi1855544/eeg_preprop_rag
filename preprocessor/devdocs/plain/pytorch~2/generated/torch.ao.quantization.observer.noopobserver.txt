# NoopObserver

`class torch.ao.quantization.observer.NoopObserver(dtype=torch.float16,
custom_op_name='')` [source]

    
Observer that doesn’t do anything and just passes its configuration to the
quantized module’s `.from_float()`.

Primarily used for quantization to float16 which doesn’t require determining
ranges.

Parameters

    
  * dtype – Quantized data type
  * custom_op_name – (temporary) specify this observer for an operator that doesn’t require any observation (Can be used in Graph Mode Passes for special case ops).
