# AdaptiveMaxPool3d

`class torch.nn.AdaptiveMaxPool3d(output_size, return_indices=False)` [source]

    
Applies a 3D adaptive max pooling over an input signal composed of several
input planes.

The output is of size Dout×Hout×WoutD_{out} \times H_{out} \times W_{out}, for
any input size. The number of output features is equal to the number of input
planes.

Parameters

    
  * output_size (Union[int, None, Tuple[Optional[int], Optional[int], Optional[int]]]) – the target output size of the image of the form Dout×Hout×WoutD_{out} \times H_{out} \times W_{out}. Can be a tuple (Dout,Hout,Wout)(D_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out}) or a single DoutD_{out} for a cube Dout×Dout×DoutD_{out} \times D_{out} \times D_{out}. DoutD_{out}, HoutH_{out} and WoutW_{out} can be either a `int`, or `None` which means the size will be the same as that of the input.
  * return_indices (bool) – if `True`, will return the indices along with the outputs. Useful to pass to nn.MaxUnpool3d. Default: `False`

Shape:

    
  * Input: (N,C,Din,Hin,Win)(N, C, D_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in}) or (C,Din,Hin,Win)(C, D_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in}).
  * Output: (N,C,Dout,Hout,Wout)(N, C, D_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out}) or (C,Dout,Hout,Wout)(C, D_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out}), where (Dout,Hout,Wout)=output_size(D_{out}, H_{out}, W_{out})=\text{output\\_size}.

#### Examples

    
    >>> # target output size of 5x7x9
    >>> m = nn.AdaptiveMaxPool3d((5, 7, 9))
    >>> input = torch.randn(1, 64, 8, 9, 10)
    >>> output = m(input)
    >>> # target output size of 7x7x7 (cube)
    >>> m = nn.AdaptiveMaxPool3d(7)
    >>> input = torch.randn(1, 64, 10, 9, 8)
    >>> output = m(input)
    >>> # target output size of 7x9x8
    >>> m = nn.AdaptiveMaxPool3d((7, None, None))
    >>> input = torch.randn(1, 64, 10, 9, 8)
    >>> output = m(input)
