# RNNCell

`class torch.ao.nn.quantized.dynamic.RNNCell(input_size, hidden_size,
bias=True, nonlinearity='tanh', dtype=torch.qint8)` [source]

    
An Elman RNN cell with tanh or ReLU non-linearity. A dynamic quantized RNNCell
module with floating point tensor as inputs and outputs. Weights are quantized
to 8 bits. We adopt the same interface as `torch.nn.RNNCell`, please see
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.RNNCell for documentation.

Examples:

    
    >>> rnn = nn.RNNCell(10, 20)
    >>> input = torch.randn(6, 3, 10)
    >>> hx = torch.randn(3, 20)
    >>> output = []
    >>> for i in range(6):
    ...     hx = rnn(input[i], hx)
    ...     output.append(hx)
