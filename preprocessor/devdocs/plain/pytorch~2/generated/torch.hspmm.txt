# torch.hspmm

`torch.hspmm(mat1, mat2, *, out=None) → Tensor`

    
Performs a matrix multiplication of a sparse COO matrix `mat1` and a strided
matrix `mat2`. The result is a (1 + 1)-dimensional hybrid COO matrix.

Parameters

    
  * mat1 (Tensor) – the first sparse matrix to be matrix multiplied
  * mat2 (Tensor) – the second strided matrix to be matrix multiplied

Keyword Arguments

    
out (Tensor, optional) – the output tensor.
