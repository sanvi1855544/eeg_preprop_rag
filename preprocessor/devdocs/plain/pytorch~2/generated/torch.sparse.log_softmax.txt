# torch.sparse.log_softmax

`torch.sparse.log_softmax(input, dim, *, dtype=None) → Tensor`

    
Applies a softmax function followed by logarithm.

See `softmax` for more details.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – input
  * dim (int) – A dimension along which softmax will be computed.
  * dtype (`torch.dtype`, optional) – the desired data type of returned tensor. If specified, the input tensor is casted to `dtype` before the operation is performed. This is useful for preventing data type overflows. Default: None
