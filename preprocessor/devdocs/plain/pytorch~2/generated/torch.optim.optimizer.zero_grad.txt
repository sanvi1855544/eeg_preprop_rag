# torch.optim.Optimizer.zero_grad

`Optimizer.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)` [source]

    
Resets the gradients of all optimized `torch.Tensor` s.

Parameters

    
set_to_none (bool) – instead of setting to zero, set the grads to None. This
will in general have lower memory footprint, and can modestly improve
performance. However, it changes certain behaviors. For example: 1. When the
user tries to access a gradient and perform manual ops on it, a None attribute
or a Tensor full of 0s will behave differently. 2. If the user requests
`zero_grad(set_to_none=True)` followed by a backward pass, `.grad`s are
guaranteed to be None for params that did not receive a gradient. 3.
`torch.optim` optimizers have a different behavior if the gradient is 0 or
None (in one case it does the step with a gradient of 0 and in the other it
skips the step altogether).
