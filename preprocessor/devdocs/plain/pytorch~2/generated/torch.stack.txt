# torch.stack

`torch.stack(tensors, dim=0, *, out=None) → Tensor`

    
Concatenates a sequence of tensors along a new dimension.

All tensors need to be of the same size.

See also

`torch.cat()` concatenates the given sequence along an existing dimension.

Parameters

    
  * tensors (sequence of Tensors) – sequence of tensors to concatenate
  * dim (int) – dimension to insert. Has to be between 0 and the number of dimensions of concatenated tensors (inclusive)

Keyword Arguments

    
out (Tensor, optional) – the output tensor.
