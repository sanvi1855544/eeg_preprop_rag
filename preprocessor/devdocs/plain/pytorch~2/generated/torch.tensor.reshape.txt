# torch.Tensor.reshape

`Tensor.reshape(*shape) → Tensor`

    
Returns a tensor with the same data and number of elements as `self` but with
the specified shape. This method returns a view if `shape` is compatible with
the current shape. See `torch.Tensor.view()` on when it is possible to return
a view.

See `torch.reshape()`

Parameters

    
shape (tuple of ints or int...) – the desired shape
