# FXE0012:unsupported-fx-node-analysis

This error indicates that an FX graph contains one or more unsupported nodes.
The error message is typically accompanied by a list of the unsupported nodes
found during analysis.

To resolve this error, you can try resolving each individual unsupported node
error by following the suggestions by its diagnostic. Typically, options
include:

  * If exists, apply the auto-fix suggested by the diagnostic. TODO: this part is not available yet.
  * Rewrite the model using only supported PyTorch operators or functions.
  * Follow this guide to write and register a custom symbolic function for the unsupported call_function FX node.
