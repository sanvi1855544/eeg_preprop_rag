# torch.take

`torch.take(input, index) → Tensor`

    
Returns a new tensor with the elements of `input` at the given indices. The
input tensor is treated as if it were viewed as a 1-D tensor. The result takes
the same shape as the indices.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the input tensor.
  * index (LongTensor) – the indices into tensor

Example:

    
    >>> src = torch.tensor([[4, 3, 5],
    ...                     [6, 7, 8]])
    >>> torch.take(src, torch.tensor([0, 2, 5]))
    tensor([ 4,  5,  8])
