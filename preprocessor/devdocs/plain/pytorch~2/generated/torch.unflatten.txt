# torch.unflatten

`torch.unflatten(input, dim, sizes) → Tensor`

    
Expands a dimension of the input tensor over multiple dimensions.

See also

`torch.flatten()` the inverse of this function. It coalesces several
dimensions into one.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the input tensor.
  * dim (int) – Dimension to be unflattened, specified as an index into `input.shape`.
  * sizes (Tuple[int]) – New shape of the unflattened dimension. One of its elements can be `-1` in which case the corresponding output dimension is inferred. Otherwise, the product of `sizes` must equal `input.shape[dim]`.

Returns

    
A View of input with the specified dimension unflattened.

Examples::

    
    
    >>> torch.unflatten(torch.randn(3, 4, 1), 1, (2, 2)).shape
    torch.Size([3, 2, 2, 1])
    >>> torch.unflatten(torch.randn(3, 4, 1), 1, (-1, 2)).shape
    torch.Size([3, 2, 2, 1])
    >>> torch.unflatten(torch.randn(5, 12, 3), -2, (2, 2, 3, 1, 1)).shape
    torch.Size([5, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3])
