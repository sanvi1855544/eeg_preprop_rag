# torch.optim.Optimizer.add_param_group

`Optimizer.add_param_group(param_group)` [source]

    
Add a param group to the `Optimizer` s `param_groups`.

This can be useful when fine tuning a pre-trained network as frozen layers can
be made trainable and added to the `Optimizer` as training progresses.

Parameters

    
param_group (dict) – Specifies what Tensors should be optimized along with
group specific optimization options.
