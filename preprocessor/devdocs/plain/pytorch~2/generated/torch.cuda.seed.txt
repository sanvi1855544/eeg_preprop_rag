# torch.cuda.seed

`torch.cuda.seed()` [source]

    
Sets the seed for generating random numbers to a random number for the current
GPU. It’s safe to call this function if CUDA is not available; in that case,
it is silently ignored.

Warning

If you are working with a multi-GPU model, this function will only initialize
the seed on one GPU. To initialize all GPUs, use `seed_all()`.
