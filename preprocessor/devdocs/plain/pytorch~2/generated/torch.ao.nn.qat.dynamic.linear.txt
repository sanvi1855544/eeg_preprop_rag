# Linear

`class torch.ao.nn.qat.dynamic.Linear(in_features, out_features, bias=True,
qconfig=None, device=None, dtype=None)` [source]

    
A linear module attached with FakeQuantize modules for weight, used for
dynamic quantization aware training.

We adopt the same interface as `torch.nn.Linear`, please see
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Linear for documentation.

Similar to `torch.nn.Linear`, with FakeQuantize modules initialized to
default.
