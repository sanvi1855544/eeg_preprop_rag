# torch.Tensor.register_hook

`Tensor.register_hook(hook)` [source]

    
Registers a backward hook.

The hook will be called every time a gradient with respect to the Tensor is
computed. The hook should have the following signature:

    
    hook(grad) -> Tensor or None
    
The hook should not modify its argument, but it can optionally return a new
gradient which will be used in place of `grad`.

This function returns a handle with a method `handle.remove()` that removes
the hook from the module.

Note

See Backward Hooks execution for more information on how when this hook is
executed, and how its execution is ordered relative to other hooks.

Example:

    
    >>> v = torch.tensor([0., 0., 0.], requires_grad=True)
    >>> h = v.register_hook(lambda grad: grad * 2)  # double the gradient
    >>> v.backward(torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.]))
    >>> v.grad
    
     2
     4
     6
    [torch.FloatTensor of size (3,)]
    
    >>> h.remove()  # removes the hook
