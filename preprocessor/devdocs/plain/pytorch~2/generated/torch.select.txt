# torch.select

`torch.select(input, dim, index) → Tensor`

    
Slices the `input` tensor along the selected dimension at the given index.
This function returns a view of the original tensor with the given dimension
removed.

Note

If `input` is a sparse tensor and returning a view of the tensor is not
possible, a RuntimeError exception is raised. In this is the case, consider
using `torch.select_copy()` function.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the input tensor.
  * dim (int) – the dimension to slice
  * index (int) – the index to select with

Note

`select()` is equivalent to slicing. For example, `tensor.select(0, index)` is
equivalent to `tensor[index]` and `tensor.select(2, index)` is equivalent to
`tensor[:,:,index]`.
