# torch.cuda.comm.broadcast

`torch.cuda.comm.broadcast(tensor, devices=None, *, out=None)` [source]

    
Broadcasts a tensor to specified GPU devices.

Parameters

    
  * tensor (Tensor) – tensor to broadcast. Can be on CPU or GPU.
  * devices (Iterable[torch.device, str or int], optional) – an iterable of GPU devices, among which to broadcast.
  * out (Sequence[Tensor], optional, keyword-only) – the GPU tensors to store output results.

Note

Exactly one of `devices` and `out` must be specified.

Returns

    
  * `If devices is specified,`
    
a tuple containing copies of `tensor`, placed on `devices`.

  * `If out is specified,`
    
a tuple containing `out` tensors, each containing a copy of `tensor`.
