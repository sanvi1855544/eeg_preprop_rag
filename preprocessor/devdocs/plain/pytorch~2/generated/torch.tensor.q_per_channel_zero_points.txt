# torch.Tensor.q_per_channel_zero_points

`Tensor.q_per_channel_zero_points() → Tensor`

    
Given a Tensor quantized by linear (affine) per-channel quantization, returns
a tensor of zero_points of the underlying quantizer. It has the number of
elements that matches the corresponding dimensions (from q_per_channel_axis)
of the tensor.
