# torch.nn.functional.lp_pool2d

`torch.nn.functional.lp_pool2d(input, norm_type, kernel_size, stride=None,
ceil_mode=False)` [source]

    
Applies a 2D power-average pooling over an input signal composed of several
input planes. If the sum of all inputs to the power of `p` is zero, the
gradient is set to zero as well.

See `LPPool2d` for details.
