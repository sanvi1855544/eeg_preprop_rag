# torch.nn.functional.linear

`torch.nn.functional.linear(input, weight, bias=None) → Tensor`

    
Applies a linear transformation to the incoming data: y=xAT+by = xA^T + b.

This operation supports 2-D `weight` with sparse layout

Warning

Sparse support is a beta feature and some layout(s)/dtype/device combinations
may not be supported, or may not have autograd support. If you notice missing
functionality please open a feature request.

This operator supports TensorFloat32.

Shape:

  * Input: (∗,in_features)(*, in\\_features) where `*` means any number of additional dimensions, including none
  * Weight: (out_features,in_features)(out\\_features, in\\_features) or (in_features)(in\\_features)
  * Bias: (out_features)(out\\_features) or ()()
  * Output: (∗,out_features)(*, out\\_features) or (∗)(*), based on the shape of the weight
