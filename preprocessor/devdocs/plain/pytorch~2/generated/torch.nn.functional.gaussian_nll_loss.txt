# torch.nn.functional.gaussian_nll_loss

`torch.nn.functional.gaussian_nll_loss(input, target, var, full=False,
eps=1e-06, reduction='mean')` [source]

    
Gaussian negative log likelihood loss.

See `GaussianNLLLoss` for details.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – expectation of the Gaussian distribution.
  * target (Tensor) – sample from the Gaussian distribution.
  * var (Tensor) – tensor of positive variance(s), one for each of the expectations in the input (heteroscedastic), or a single one (homoscedastic).
  * full (bool, optional) – include the constant term in the loss calculation. Default: `False`.
  * eps (float, optional) – value added to var, for stability. Default: 1e-6.
  * reduction (str, optional) – specifies the reduction to apply to the output: `'none'` | `'mean'` | `'sum'`. `'none'`: no reduction will be applied, `'mean'`: the output is the average of all batch member losses, `'sum'`: the output is the sum of all batch member losses. Default: `'mean'`.

Return type

    
Tensor
