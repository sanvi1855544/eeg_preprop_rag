# torch.mode

`torch.mode(input, dim=-1, keepdim=False, *, out=None)`

    
Returns a namedtuple `(values, indices)` where `values` is the mode value of
each row of the `input` tensor in the given dimension `dim`, i.e. a value
which appears most often in that row, and `indices` is the index location of
each mode value found.

By default, `dim` is the last dimension of the `input` tensor.

If `keepdim` is `True`, the output tensors are of the same size as `input`
except in the dimension `dim` where they are of size 1. Otherwise, `dim` is
squeezed (see `torch.squeeze()`), resulting in the output tensors having 1
fewer dimension than `input`.

Note

This function is not defined for `torch.cuda.Tensor` yet.

Parameters

    
  * input (Tensor) – the input tensor.
  * dim (int) – the dimension to reduce.
  * keepdim (bool) – whether the output tensor has `dim` retained or not.

Keyword Arguments

    
out (tuple, optional) – the result tuple of two output tensors (values,
indices)

Example:

    
    >>> a = torch.randint(10, (5,))
    >>> a
    tensor([6, 5, 1, 0, 2])
    >>> b = a + (torch.randn(50, 1) * 5).long()
    >>> torch.mode(b, 0)
    torch.return_types.mode(values=tensor([6, 5, 1, 0, 2]), indices=tensor([2, 2, 2, 2, 2]))
