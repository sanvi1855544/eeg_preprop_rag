# torch.Tensor.log_normal_

`Tensor.log_normal_(mean=1, std=2, *, generator=None)`

    
Fills `self` tensor with numbers samples from the log-normal distribution
parameterized by the given mean μ\mu and standard deviation σ\sigma. Note that
`mean` and `std` are the mean and standard deviation of the underlying normal
distribution, and not of the returned distribution:

f(x)=1xσ2πe−(ln⁡x−μ)22σ2f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x \sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}\ e^{-\frac{(\ln
x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
