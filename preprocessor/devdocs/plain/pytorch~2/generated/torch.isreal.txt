# torch.isreal

`torch.isreal(input) → Tensor`

    
Returns a new tensor with boolean elements representing if each element of
`input` is real-valued or not. All real-valued types are considered real.
Complex values are considered real when their imaginary part is 0.

Parameters

    
input (Tensor) – the input tensor.

Returns

    
A boolean tensor that is True where `input` is real and False elsewhere

Example:

    
    >>> torch.isreal(torch.tensor([1, 1+1j, 2+0j]))
    tensor([True, False, True])
