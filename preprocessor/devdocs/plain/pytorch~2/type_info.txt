# Type Info

The numerical properties of a `torch.dtype` can be accessed through either the
`torch.finfo` or the `torch.iinfo`.

## torch.finfo

`class torch.finfo`

A `torch.finfo` is an object that represents the numerical properties of a
floating point `torch.dtype`, (i.e. `torch.float32`, `torch.float64`,
`torch.float16`, and `torch.bfloat16`). This is similar to numpy.finfo.

A `torch.finfo` provides the following attributes:

Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
bits | int | The number of bits occupied by the type.  
eps | float | The smallest representable number such that `1.0 + eps != 1.0`.  
max | float | The largest representable number.  
min | float | The smallest representable number (typically `-max`).  
tiny | float | The smallest positive normal number. Equivalent to `smallest_normal`.  
smallest_normal | float | The smallest positive normal number. See notes.  
resolution | float | The approximate decimal resolution of this type, i.e., `10**-precision`.  
Note

The constructor of `torch.finfo` can be called without argument, in which case
the class is created for the pytorch default dtype (as returned by
`torch.get_default_dtype()`).

Note

`smallest_normal` returns the smallest normal number, but there are smaller
subnormal numbers. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormal_number for more
information.

## torch.iinfo

`class torch.iinfo`

A `torch.iinfo` is an object that represents the numerical properties of a
integer `torch.dtype` (i.e. `torch.uint8`, `torch.int8`, `torch.int16`,
`torch.int32`, and `torch.int64`). This is similar to numpy.iinfo.

A `torch.iinfo` provides the following attributes:

Name | Type | Description  
---|---|---  
bits | int | The number of bits occupied by the type.  
max | int | The largest representable number.  
min | int | The smallest representable number.
