# torch

The torch package contains data structures for multi-dimensional tensors and
defines mathematical operations over these tensors. Additionally, it provides
many utilities for efficient serialization of Tensors and arbitrary types, and
other useful utilities.

It has a CUDA counterpart, that enables you to run your tensor computations on
an NVIDIA GPU with compute capability >= 3.0.

## Locally disabling gradient computation

The context managers `torch.no_grad()`, `torch.enable_grad()`, and
`torch.set_grad_enabled()` are helpful for locally disabling and enabling
gradient computation. See Locally disabling gradient computation for more
details on their usage. These context managers are thread local, so they won’t
work if you send work to another thread using the `threading` module, etc.

Examples:

    
    >>> x = torch.zeros(1, requires_grad=True)
    >>> with torch.no_grad():
    ...     y = x * 2
    >>> y.requires_grad
    False
    
    >>> is_train = False
    >>> with torch.set_grad_enabled(is_train):
    ...     y = x * 2
    >>> y.requires_grad
    False
    
    >>> torch.set_grad_enabled(True)  # this can also be used as a function
    >>> y = x * 2
    >>> y.requires_grad
    True
    
    >>> torch.set_grad_enabled(False)
    >>> y = x * 2
    >>> y.requires_grad
    False

## Symbolic Numbers

`class torch.SymInt(node)` [source]

    
Like an int (including magic methods), but redirects all operations on the
wrapped node. This is used in particular to symbolically record operations in
the symbolic shape workflow.

`class torch.SymFloat(node)` [source]

    
Like an float (including magic methods), but redirects all operations on the
wrapped node. This is used in particular to symbolically record operations in
the symbolic shape workflow.

`class torch.SymBool(node)` [source]

    
Like an bool (including magic methods), but redirects all operations on the
wrapped node. This is used in particular to symbolically record operations in
the symbolic shape workflow.

Unlike regular bools, regular boolean operators will force extra guards
instead of symbolically evaluate. Use the bitwise operators instead to handle
this.
