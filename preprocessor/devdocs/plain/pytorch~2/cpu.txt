# torch.cpu

This package implements abstractions found in `torch.cuda` to facilitate
writing device-agnostic code.

`current_stream` | Returns the currently selected `Stream` for a given device.  
---|---  
`is_available` | Returns a bool indicating if CPU is currently available.  
`synchronize` | Waits for all kernels in all streams on the CPU device to complete.  
`stream` | Wrapper around the Context-manager StreamContext that selects a given stream.  
`device_count` | Returns number of CPU devices (not cores).  
`StreamContext` | Context-manager that selects a given stream.  
## Streams and events

`Stream` | N.B.
